Diffie-Hellman: issues
• Diffie-Hellman is not secure against a MITM adversary
• Diffie-Hellman does not provide authentication
• You exchanged keys with someone, but Diffie-Hellman makes no guarantees 
about who you exchanged keys with; it could be David!
• DHE is an active protocol: Alice and Bob need to be online at the 
same time to exchange keys
• What if Bob wants to encrypt something and send it to Alice for her to read 
later?

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Summary
• Algorithm:
• Alice chooses 𝑋! and sends 𝛼"! 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑞to Bob
• Bob chooses 𝑋# and sends 𝛼"" 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑞to Alice
• Their shared secret is (𝛼"!)""= (𝛼"")"!= 𝛼"!"" 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑞
• Diffie-Hellman provides forwards secrecy: Nothing is saved or can be 
recorded that can ever recover the key
• Diffie-Hellman can be performed over other mathematical groups, 
such as elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
• Issues
• Not secure against MITM
• Does not provide authenticity
• Both parties must be online

Consider a Diffie-Hellman scheme with a common prime 𝑞= 11 and a primitive 
root 𝛼= 2.
a. if user A has public key 𝑌! = 9, what is A’s private key 𝑋!?
b. If user B has public key 𝑌# = 3, what is the shared secret key 𝐾?

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
• Originally independently proposed by Neal Koblitz (University of 
Washington) and Victor Miller (IBM) in 1985. 
• ECC was proposed as an alternative to other public key encryption 
algorithms, for example RSA. 
• All ECC schemes are public key

Why ECC? 
• In case of ECC, we are able to use smaller primes, or smaller finite fields, and 
achieve a level of security comparable to that of RSA
• ECC has lower computational requirements. For this reason, ECC algorithms can 
be easily implemented on smart cards, pagers, or mobile devices. Some smart 
cards can only work with ECC.

ECC Key Generation
• Let k be an integer and G a point on E. k×G is defined as adding G to 
itself k times. 
• Once we calculate Q = k × G, it is extremely difficult to recover k from 
Q. The only way to recover k from Q is to try every possible repeated 
addition of G. 
• Q: Does it sound familiar?

Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem 
(ECDLP)
• Let G be a point on E. Compute Q = k × G. Then, ECDLP: given G and Q 
compute k. 
• This allows us to translate crypto schemes based on DLP to EC-based 
schemes. 
• Q is a public key. k is a private key. G is a generator point on E.

Summary
• ECC achieves strong security with small keys.
• Based on the hardness of ECDLP.
• Powers many modern systems (TLS, blockchain, mobile apps).
