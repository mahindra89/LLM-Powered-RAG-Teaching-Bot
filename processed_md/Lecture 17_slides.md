Existentially unforgeable
• A secure MAC is existentially unforgeable: without the key, an 
attacker cannot create a valid tag on a message
• David cannot generate MAC(K, M') without K
• David cannot find any M' ≠ M such that MAC(K, M') = MAC(K, M)


## Page 2

Example: HMAC
• issued as RFC 2104 [1]
• has been chosen as the mandatory-to-implement MAC for IP Security
• Used in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Electronic 
Transaction (SET)
[1] “HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication”, RFC 2104, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104

HMAC(K, M)
• will produce two keys to increase security
• If key is longer than the desired size, we can hash it first, but be 
careful with using keys that are too much smaller, they have to have 
enough randomness in them
• Output H[(K+ ⊕opad) || H[(K+ ⊕ipad) || M]]


## Page 4

Example: HMAC
• HMAC(K, M):
• Output H[(K+ ⊕opad) || H[(K+ ⊕ipad) || M]]
• Use K to derive two different keys
• opad (outer pad) is the hard-coded byte 0x5c repeated until it’s the same 
length as K+
• ipad (inner pad) is the hard-coded byte 0x36 repeated until it’s the same 
length as K+
• As long as opad and ipad are different, you’ll get two different keys
• For paranoia, the designers chose two very different bit patterns, even though 
they theoretically need only differ in one bit

HMAC procedure
• Step 1: Append zeros to the left end of K to create a b-bit string K+ (e.g., if K 
is of length 160 bits and b = 512, then K will be appended with 44 zero 
bytes); 
• Step 2: XOR (bitwise exclusive-OR) K+ with ipad to produce the b-bit block 
Si;
• Step 3: Append M to Si ;
• Step 4: Apply H to the stream generated in step 3; 
• Step 5: XOR K+ with opad to produce the b-bit block So ;
• Step 6: Append the hash result from step 4 to So ;
• Step 7: Apply H to the stream generated in step 6 and output the result.

HMAC Properties
• HMAC(K, M) = H[(K+ ⊕opad) || H((K+ ⊕ipad) || M]]
• HMAC is a hash funcTon, so it has the properTes of the underlying 
hash too
• It is collision resistant
• Given HMAC(K, M), an aJacker can’t learn M – one way
• If the underlying hash is secure, HMAC doesn’t reveal M, but it is sKll 
determinisKc
• You can’t verify a tag T if you don’t have K
• This means that an aWacker can’t brute-force the message M without 
knowing K

MACs: Summary
• Inputs: a secret key and a message
• Output: a tag on the message
• A secure MAC is unforgeable: Even if David can trick Alice into 
creating MACs for messages that David chooses, David cannot create 
a valid MAC on a message that she hasn't seen before
• Example: HMAC(K, M) = H((K+ ⊕opad) || H((K+ ⊕ipad) || M))
• MACs do not provide confidentiality


## Page 9

Do MACs provide integrity? 
• Do MACs provide integrity?
• Yes. An attacker cannot tamper with the message without being detected
• Do MACs provide authenticity?
• It depends on your threat model
• If only two people have the secret key, MACs provide authenticity: it has a 
valid MAC, and it’s not from me, so it must be from the other person
• More than one secret key, If a message has a valid MAC, you can be sure it 
came from someone with the secret key, but you can’t narrow it down to one 
person

Authenticated Encryption


## Page 11

Authenticated Encryption: Definition
• Authenticated encryption (AE): A scheme that simultaneously 
guarantees confidentiality and integrity (and authenticity, depending 
on your threat model) on a message
• Two ways of achieving authenticated encryption:
• Combine schemes that provide confidentiality with schemes that provide 
integrity
• Use a scheme that is designed to provide confidentiality and integrity


## Page 12

Scratchpad: Let’s design it together
• You can use:
• An encryption scheme: Enc(K, M) and Dec(K, M)
• An unforgeable MAC scheme (e.g. HMAC): MAC(K, M)
• First attempt: Alice sends Enc(K1, M) and MAC(K2, M)
• Integrity? Yes, attacker can’t tamper with the MAC
• Confidentiality? No, the MAC is not secure
• Idea 1: Let’s compute the MAC on the ciphertext instead of the plaintext:
Enc(K1, M) and MAC(k2, Enc(K1, M))
• Integrity? Yes, attacker can’t tamper with the MAC
• Confidentiality? Yes, the MAC might leak info about the ciphertext, but that’s okay
• Idea 2: Let’s encrypt the MAC too: Enc(K1, M || MAC(K2, M))
• Integrity? Yes, attacker can’t tamper with the MAC
• Confidentiality? Yes, everything is encrypted
