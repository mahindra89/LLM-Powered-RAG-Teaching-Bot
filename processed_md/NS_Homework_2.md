Q.1. What are the pros and cons of public-key cryptography? (4 points) 
Ans: 
Public-key cryptography is a type of encryption that encrypts and decrypts data using two separate keys 
called public key and private key. 
 
• 
Pros or Advantages: 
 
• 
Easy key distribution. 
 
• 
No longer need to assume that Alice and Bob already share a secret. 
 
• 
Cons or Disadvantages: 
 
• 
Much slower than symmetric-key cryptography. 
 
• 
Number theory calculations are much slower than XORs and bit-shifts. 
 
Q.2. What are the properties of public key encryption? (4 points) 
Ans: 
 
• 
Correctness: Decrypting a ciphertext should result in the message that was originally 
encrypted. 
 Dec(SK, Enc(PK, M)) = M  for all PK, SK from KeyGen() and M. 
 
• 
Efficiency: Encryption/decryption should be fast. 
 
• 
Security: Computationally infeasible to recover M with PK and ciphertext. 
 
Q.3. Describe the steps of public key encryption with example (4 points) 
Ans: Steps for Public Key Encryption: 
 
1. 
Generate a pair of keys. 
 
2. 
Keep the private key (SK) and distribute the public key (PK). 
 
• 
Place PK in a public register or other accessible file. 
 
3. 
Bob encrypts the message with Alice’s PK. 
 
4. 
Upon receiving the ciphertext (CT), Alice decrypts CT with SK. 
 
Q.4. Which categories should be used to classify public key cryptography algorithms? (4 points) 
Ans:

Q.6. What are the possible attacks exploiting RSA’s properties? (4 points) 
Ans: 
 
1. 
Mathematical Attacks: Several approaches, all equivalent in effort to factoring the 
product of two primes. Defense: Use a large key size.

of data. These attacks can be thwarted by suitable padding of the plaintext, such as PKCS1 V1.5 in SSL. 
 
Q.7. What is meant by message authentication? (4 points) 
Ans: 
Message authentication is concerned with: 
 
1. 
Protecting the integrity of a message. 
 
2. 
Validating the identity of the originator. 
 
3. 
Non-repudiation of origin (dispute resolution). 
 
Q.8. What are the 3 approaches to achieve message authentication? (4 points) 
Ans: 
Message authentication is the process of verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message. The three 
approaches are: 
 
1. 
Message Encryption: 
 
• 
Provides a measure of authentication. 
 
• 
If symmetric encryption is used: 
 
1. 
Receiver knows sender who must have created the message. 
 
2. 
Only the sender and receiver know the key used. 
 
3. 
Known content cannot be altered. 
 
• 
If public-key encryption is used: 
 
1. 
Encryption provides no confidence of sender. 
 
2. 
Since anyone potentially knows the public key, recognition of corrupted messages is 
necessary. 
 
2. 
Message Authentication Code (MAC): 
 
• 
Uses a cryptographic technique with a secret key to verify message integrity. 
 
3. 
Digital Signatures: 
 
• 
Uses the sender’s private key to sign the message and the corresponding public key to 
verify authenticity.

Ans: 
 
• 
Pros: 
 
1.

Cons: 
 
1. 
Key distribution assumes a secure channel.

Does not protect sender from receiver forging a message and claiming it’s sent by the 
sender. 
 
3. 
Does not scale well for large networks (requires separate keys for each pair).

H(x{\prime}) . 
 
6.
