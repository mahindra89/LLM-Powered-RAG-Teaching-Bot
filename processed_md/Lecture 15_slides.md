Message Authentication


## Page 2

Message authentication
• message authentication is concerned with: 
• protecting the integrity of a message 
• validating identity of originator 
• non-repudiation of origin (dispute resolution)
• then three alternative functions used:
• message encryption – symmetric
• message authentication code (MAC)
• digital signature


## Page 3

Message encryption
• Symmetric message encryption by itself also provides a measure of 
authentication
• if symmetric encryption is used then:
• receiver knows sender must have created it
• since only sender and receiver know key used
• know content cannot be altered


## Page 4

Message encryption
• if public-key encryption is used:
• encryption provides no confidence of sender
• since anyone potentially knows public-key
• so, need to recognize corrupted messages
• however, if 
• sender signs message using their private-key
• then encrypts with recipients’ public key
• have both secrecy and authentication
• but at cost of two public-key uses on message


## Page 5

Reasons to avoid encryption authentication
• Encryption software is quite slow
• Encryption hardware costs are nonnegligible
• Encryption hardware is optimized toward large data sizes
• An encryption algorithm may be protected by a patent

Hash Function


## Page 7

Hash functions
• Hash function: h = H(M)
• M can be of any size 
• h is always of fixed size 
• Typically, h << size(M) 


## Page 8

One use case - using hash function
• Message, M
• A calculates MDM = H (M)
• B recalculates MD’M, and check
• MD’M = MDM


## Page 9

One use case - using hash function
• Initialization: A and B share a 
common secret, SAB
• Message, M
• A calculates MDM = H (SAB || M)
• B recalculates MD’M, and check
• MD’M = MDM


## Page 10

Requirements for secure hash functions
• 1. can be applied to any sized message M
• 2. produces fixed-length output h
• 3. is easy to compute h=H(M) for any message M
• 4. given h is infeasible to find x s.t. H(x)=h
• one-way property or preimage resistance
• 5. given x is infeasible to find x’ s.t. H(x’)=H(x)
• weak collision resistance or second pre-image resistant
• 6. infeasible to find any pair of x,x’ s.t. H(x’)=H(x)
• strong collision resistance


## Page 11

Hash Function: Collision Resistance
• Collision: Two different inputs with the same output
• x ≠ x' and H(x) = H(x')
• Can we design a hash function with no collisions?
• No, because there are more inputs than outputs (pigeonhole principle)
• However, we want to make finding collisions infeasible for an attacker
• Collision resistance: It is infeasible to (i.e. no polynomial time attacker 
can) find any pair of inputs x' ≠ x such that H(x) = H(x')

Secure hash function
• A hash function that satisfies the first five properties is referred to as 
a weak hash function
• Security: random/unpredictability, no predictable patterns for how 
changing the input affects the output
• Changing 1 bit in the input causes the output to be completely different
• Also called “random oracle” assumption

Secure hash function
• A hash function that satisfies the first five properties is referred to as

• Security: random/unpredictability, no predictable patterns for how

• Changing 1 bit in the input causes the output to be completely different
• Also called “random oracle” assumption
• A message digest
• output of a cryptographic hash function containing a string of digits created 
by a one-way hashing formula
• provides data integrity
• Examples: SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), SHA-2, SHA-3, MD5


## Page 14

Hash Function: Examples
• MD5
• Output: 128 bits
• Security: Completely broken
• SHA-1
• Output: 160 bits
• Security: Completely broken in 2017
• Was known to be weak before 2017, but still used sometimes
• SHA-2
• Output: 256, 384, or 512 bits (sometimes labeled SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
• Not currently broken, but some variants are vulnerable to a length extension attack
• Current standard
• SHA-3 (Keccak)
• Output: 256, 384, or 512 bits
• Current standard (not meant to replace SHA-2, just a different construction)
