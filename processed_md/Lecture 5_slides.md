Two basic types
• Block Ciphers 
• Typically 64, 128 bit blocks
• A k-bit plaintext block maps to a k-bit ciphertext block 
• Usually employ Feistel structure 
• Stream Ciphers
• A key is used to generate a stream of pseudo-random bits – key stream
• Just XOR plaintext bits with the key stream for encryption 
• For decryption generate the key stream and XOR with the ciphertext!

Symmetric Block Encryption


## Page 3

Block cipher
• the most commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms
• input: fixed-size blocks (Typically 64, 128 bit blocks), output: equal 
size blocks
• provide secrecy and/or authentication services
• Data Encryption Standard (DES), triple DES (3DES), and the Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES)s
• Usually employ Feistel structure

Feistel Cipher Structure
• most symmetric block ciphers are based on a Feistel Cipher Structure
• based on the two primitive cryptographic operations
• substitution (S-box)
• permutation (P-box)
• provide confusion and diffusion of message 


## Page 6

Feistel Cipher Structure
• Horst Feistel devised the feistel cipher in the 1973
• based on concept of invertible product cipher
• partitions input block into two halves
• process through multiple rounds which
• perform a substitution on left data half
• based on round function of right half & subkey
• then have permutation swapping halves
• implements Shannon’s substitution-permutation network concept
