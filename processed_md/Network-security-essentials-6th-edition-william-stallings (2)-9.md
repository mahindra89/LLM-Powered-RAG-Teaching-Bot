reports are similar in format to aggregation reports, with these changes: ■ Receivers 
include as much of the message and message header as is reasonable to allow the domain 
to investigate the failure. Add an Identity-Alignment field, with DKIM and SPF DMARC-
method fields as appropriate. ■ Optionally add a Delivery-Result field. ■ Add DKIM 
Domain, DKIM Identity, and DKIM selector fields, if the message was DKIM signed. 
Optionally also add DKIM Canonical header and body fields. ■ Add an additional DMARC 
authentication failure type, for use when some authentication mechanisms fail to produce 
aligned identifiers. 300 chapter 8 / Electronic Mail Security 8.11 Key Terms, Review

There are application-specific security mechanisms for a number of application areas, 
including electronic mail (S/MIME, PGP), client/server (Kerberos), Web access (Secure 
Sockets Layer), and others. However, users have security concerns that cut across 
protocol layers. For example, an enterprise can run a secure, private IP network by 
disallowing links to untrusted sites, encrypting packets that leave the premises, and 
authenticating packets that enter the premises. By implementing security at the IP level, 
an organization can ensure secure networking not only for applications that have security 
mechanisms but also for the many security-ignorant applications. IP-level security 
encompasses three functional areas: authentication, confidentiality, and key 
management. The authentication mechanism assures that a received packet was, in fact, 
transmitted by the party identified as the source in the packet header. In addition, this 
mechanism assures that the packet has not been altered in transit. The confidentiality 
facility enables communicating nodes to encrypt messages to prevent eavesdropping by 
third parties. The key management facility is concerned with the secure exchange of keys. 
We begin this chapter with an overview of IP security (IPsec) and an introduction to the 
IPsec architecture. We then look at each of the three functional areas in detail. Appendix D 
reviews Internet protocols. 9.1 Ip Security Overview In 1994, the Internet Architecture 
Board (IAB) issued a report titled “Security in the Internet Architecture” (RFC 1636). The 
report identified key areas for security mechanisms. Among these were the need to secure 
the network infrastructure from Learning Objectives After studying this chapter, you

difference between transport mode and tunnel mode. ◆◆ Understand the concept of 
security association. ◆◆ Explain the difference between the security association

Security unauthorized monitoring and control of network traffic and the need to secure 
enduser-to-end-user traffic using authentication and encryption mechanisms. To provide 
security, the IAB included authentication and encryption as necessary security features in 
the next-generation IP, which has been issued as IPv6. Fortunately, these security 


## Page 3

capabilities were designed to be usable both with the current IPv4 and the future IPv6. This 
means that vendors can begin offering these features now, and many vendors now do have 
some IPsec capability in their products. The IPsec specification now exists as a set of 
Internet standards. Applications of IPsec IPsec provides the capability to secure 
communications across a LAN, across private and public WANs, and across the Internet. 
Examples of its use include: ■ Secure branch office connectivity over the Internet: A 
company can build a secure virtual private network over the Internet or over a public WAN. 
This enables a business to rely heavily on the Internet and reduce its need for private 
networks, saving costs and network management overhead. ■ Secure remote access over 
the Internet: An end user whose system is equipped with IP security protocols can make a 
local call to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and gain secure access to a company 
network. This reduces the cost of toll charges for traveling employees and telecommuters. 
■ Establishing extranet and intranet connectivity with partners: IPsec can be used to 
secure communication with other organizations, ensuring authentication and 
confidentiality and providing a key exchange mechanism. ■ Enhancing electronic 
commerce security: Even though some Web and electronic commerce applications have 
built-in security protocols, the use of IPsec enhances that security. IPsec guarantees that 
all traffic designated by the network administrator is both encrypted and authenticated, 
adding an additional layer of security to whatever is provided at the application layer. The 
principal feature of IPsec that enables it to support these varied applications is that it can 
encrypt and/or authenticate all traffic at the IP level. Thus, all distributed applications 
(including remote logon, client/server, e-mail, file transfer, Web access, and so on) can be 
secured. Figure 9.1a shows a simplified packet format for an IPsec option known as tunnel 
mode, described subsequently. Tunnel mode makes use of an IPsec function, a combined 
authentication/encryption function called Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and a key 
exchange function. For VPNs, both authentication and encryption are generally desired, 
because it is important both to (1) assure that unauthorized users do not penetrate the 
VPN, and (2) assure that eavesdroppers on the Internet cannot read messages sent over 
the VPN. Figure 9.1b is a typical scenario of IPsec usage. An organization maintains LANs 
at dispersed locations. Nonsecure IP traffic is conducted on each LAN. For traffic offsite, 
through some sort of private or public WAN, IPsec protocols are used. These protocols 
operate in networking devices, such as a router or firewall, that connect each LAN to the 
outside world. The IPsec networking device will typically encrypt all traffic going into the 
WAN and decrypt traffic coming from the WAN; these operations are transparent to 
workstations and servers on the LAN. Secure 9.1 / Ip Security Overview 305 transmission is 
also possible with individual users who dial into the WAN. Such user workstations must 
implement the IPsec protocols to provide security. Benefits of IPsec Some of the benefits 
of IPsec: ■ When IPsec is implemented in a firewall or router, it provides strong security 
that can be applied to all traffic crossing the perimeter. Traffic within a company or 
workgroup does not incur the overhead of security-related processing. Figure 9.1 An IPSec

/ IP Security ■ IPsec in a firewall is resistant to bypass if all traffic from the outside must 
use IP and the firewall is the only means of entrance from the Internet into the 
organization. ■ IPsec is below the transport layer (TCP, UDP) and so is transparent to 
applications. There is no need to change software on a user or server system when IPsec is 


## Page 4

implemented in the firewall or router. Even if IPsec is implemented in end systems, upper-
layer software, including applications, is not affected. ■ IPsec can be transparent to end 
users. There is no need to train users on security mechanisms, issue keying material on a 
per-user basis, or revoke keying material when users leave the organization. ■ IPsec can 
provide security for individual users if needed. This is useful for offsite workers and for 
setting up a secure virtual subnetwork within an organization for sensitive applications. 
Routing Applications In addition to supporting end users and protecting premises systems 
and networks, IPsec can play a vital role in the routing architecture required for 
internetworking. [HUIT98] lists the following examples of the use of IPsec. IPsec can 
assure that ■ A router advertisement (a new router advertises its presence) comes from an 
authorized router. ■ A neighbor advertisement (a router seeks to establish or maintain a 
neighbor relationship with a router in another routing domain) comes from an authorized 
router. ■ A redirect message comes from the router to which the initial IP packet was sent. 
■ A routing update is not forged. Without such security measures, an opponent can disrupt 
communications or divert some traffic. Routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First 
(OSPF) should be run on top of security associations between routers that are defined by 
IPsec. IPsec Documents IPsec encompasses three functional areas: authentication, 
confidentiality, and key management. The totality of the IPsec specification is scattered 
across dozens of RFCs and draft IETF documents, making this the most complex and 
difficult to grasp of all IETF specifications. The best way to grasp the scope of IPsec is to 
consult the latest version of the IPsec document roadmap, which as of this writing is RFC 
6071 (IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap, February 
2011). The documents can be categorized into the following groups. ■ Architecture: Covers 
the general concepts, security requirements, definitions, and mechanisms defining IPsec 
technology. The current specification is RFC 4301, Security Architecture for the Internet 
Protocol. 9.1 / Ip Security Overview 307 ■ Authentication Header (AH): AH is an extension 
header to provide message authentication. The current specification is RFC 4302, IP 
Authentication Header. Because message authentication is provided by ESP, the use of AH 
is deprecated. It is included in IPsecv3 for backward compatibility but should not be used 
in new applications. We do not discuss AH in this chapter. ■ Encapsulating Security 
Payload (ESP): ESP consists of an encapsulating header and trailer used to provide 
encryption or combined encryption/ authentication. The current specification is RFC 4303, 
IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). ■ Internet Key Exchange (IKE): This is a collection 
of documents describing the key management schemes for use with IPsec. The main 
specification is RFC 7296, Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol, but there are a number 
of related RFCs. ■ Cryptographic algorithms: This category encompasses a large set of 
documents that define and describe cryptographic algorithms for encryption, message 
authentication, pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and cryptographic key exchange. ■ 
Other: There are a variety of other IPsec-related RFCs, including those dealing with 
security policy and management information base (MIB) content. IPsec Services IPsec 
provides security services at the IP layer by enabling a system to select required security 
protocols, determine the algorithm(s) to use for the service(s), and put in place any 
cryptographic keys required to provide the requested services. Two protocols are used to 
provide security: an authentication protocol designated by the header of the protocol, 
Authentication Header (AH); and a combined encryption/authentication protocol 
designated by the format of the packet for that protocol, Encapsulating Security Payload 
(ESP). RFC 4301 lists the following services: ■ Access control ■ Connectionless integrity ■ 
Data origin authentication ■ Rejection of replayed packets (a form of partial sequence 


## Page 5

integrity) ■ Confidentiality (encryption) ■ Limited traffic flow confidentiality Transport and 
Tunnel Modes Both AH and ESP support two modes of use: transport and tunnel mode. The 
operation of these two modes is best understood in the context of a description of ESP, 
which is covered in Section 9.3. Here we provide a brief overview. 308 chapter 9 / IP 
Security Transport Mode Transport mode provides protection primarily for upper-layer 
protocols. That is, transport mode protection extends to the payload of an IP packet.1 
Examples include a TCP or UDP segment or an ICMP packet, all of which operate directly 
above IP in a host protocol stack. Typically, transport mode is used for end-to-end 
communication between two hosts (e.g., a client and a server, or two workstations). When 
a host runs AH or ESP over IPv4, the payload is the data that normally follow the IP header. 
For IPv6, the payload is the data that normally follow both the IP header and any IPv6 
extensions headers that are present, with the possible exception of the destination 
options header, which may be included in the protection. ESP in transport mode encrypts 
and optionally authenticates the IP payload but not the IP header. AH in transport mode 
authenticates the IP payload and selected portions of the IP header. Tunnel Mode Tunnel 
mode provides protection to the entire IP packet. To achieve this, after the AH or ESP fields 
are added to the IP packet, the entire packet plus security fields is treated as the payload 
of new outer IP packet with a new outer IP header. The entire original, inner, packet travels 
through a tunnel from one point of an IP network to another; no routers along the way are 
able to examine the inner IP header. Because the original packet is encapsulated, the new, 
larger packet may have totally different source and destination addresses, adding to the 
security. Tunnel mode is used when one or both ends of a security association (SA) are a 
security gateway, such as a firewall or router that implements IPsec. With tunnel mode, a 
number of hosts on networks behind firewalls may engage in secure communications 
without implementing IPsec. The unprotected packets generated by such hosts are 
tunneled through external networks by tunnel mode SAs set up by the IPsec software in 
the firewall or secure router at the boundary of the local network. Here is an example of 
how tunnel mode IPsec operates. Host A on a network generates an IP packet with the 
destination address of host B on another network. This packet is routed from the 
originating host to a firewall or secure router at the boundary of A’s network. The firewall 
filters all outgoing packets to determine the need for IPsec processing. If this packet from 
A to B requires IPsec, the firewall performs IPsec processing and encapsulates the packet 
with an outer IP header. The source IP address of this outer IP packet is this firewall, and 
the destination address may be a firewall that forms the boundary to B’s local network. 
This packet is now routed to B’s firewall, with intermediate routers examining only the 
outer IP header. At B’s firewall, the outer IP header is stripped off, and the inner packet is 
delivered to B. ESP in tunnel mode encrypts and optionally authenticates the entire inner 
IP packet, including the inner IP header. AH in tunnel mode authenticates the entire inner 
IP packet and selected portions of the outer IP header. Table 9.1 summarizes transport 
and tunnel mode functionality. 1 In this chapter, the term IP packet refers to either an IPv4 
datagram or an IPv6 packet. 9.2 / Ip Security Policy 309 9.2 Ip Security Policy Fundamental 
to the operation of IPsec is the concept of a security policy applied to each IP packet that 
transits from a source to a destination. IPsec policy is determined primarily by the 
interaction of two databases, the security association database (SAD) and the security 
policy database (SPD). This section provides an overview of these two databases and then 
summarizes their use during IPsec operation. Figure 9.2 illustrates the relevant 
relationships. Security Associations A key concept that appears in both the authentication 
and confidentiality mechanisms for IP is the security association (SA). An association is a 


## Page 6

one-way logical connection between a sender and a receiver that affords security services 
to the traffic carried on it. If a peer relationship is needed for two-way secure exchange, 
then two security associations are required. A security association is uniquely identified 
by three parameters. ■ Security Parameters Index (SPI): A 32-bit unsigned integer assigned 
to this SA and having local significance only. The SPI is carried in AH and ESP headers to 
enable the receiving system to select the SA under which a received packet will be 
processed. ■ IP Destination Address: This is the address of the destination endpoint of the 
SA, which may be an end-user system or a network system such as a firewall or router. ■ 
Security Protocol Identifier: This field from the outer IP header indicates whether the 
association is an AH or ESP security association. Hence, in any IP packet, the security 
association is uniquely identified by the Destination Address in the IPv4 or IPv6 header and 
the SPI in the enclosed extension header (AH or ESP). Transport Mode SA Tunnel Mode SA 
AH Authenticates IP payload and selected portions of IP header and IPv6 extension 
headers. Authenticates entire inner IP packet (inner header plus IP payload) plus selected 
portions of outer IP header and outer IPv6 extension headers. ESP Encrypts IP payload and 
any IPv6 extension headers following the ESP header. Encrypts entire inner IP packet. ESP 
with Authentication Encrypts IP payload and any IPv6 extension headers following the ESP 
header. Authenticates IP payload but not IP header. Encrypts entire inner IP packet. 
Authenticates inner IP packet. Table 9.1 Tunnel Mode and Transport Mode Functionality 
310 chapter 9 / IP Security Security Association Database In each IPsec implementation, 
there is a nominal2 Security Association Database that defines the parameters associated 
with each SA. A security association is normally defined by the following parameters in an 
SAD entry. ■ Security Parameter Index: A 32-bit value selected by the receiving end of an 
SA to uniquely identify the SA. In an SAD entry for an outbound SA, the SPI is used to 
construct the packet’s AH or ESP header. In an SAD entry for an inbound SA, the SPI is 
used to map traffic to the appropriate SA. ■ Sequence Number Counter: A 32-bit value 
used to generate the Sequence Number field in AH or ESP headers, described in Section 
9.3 (required for all implementations). ■ Sequence Counter Overflow: A flag indicating 
whether overflow of the Sequence Number Counter should generate an auditable event 
and prevent further transmission of packets on this SA (required for all implementations). 
■ Anti-Replay Window: Used to determine whether an inbound AH or ESP packet is a 
replay, described in Section 9.3 (required for all implementations). ■ AH Information: 
Authentication algorithm, keys, key lifetimes, and related parameters being used with AH 
(required for AH implementations). ■ ESP Information: Encryption and authentication 
algorithm, keys, initialization values, key lifetimes, and related parameters being used 
with ESP (required for ESP implementations). ■ Lifetime of this Security Association: A 
time interval or byte count after which an SA must be replaced with a new SA (and new SPI) 
or terminated, plus an indication of which of these actions should occur (required for all 
implementations). 2 Nominal in the sense that the functionality provided by a Security 
Association Database must be present in any IPsec implementation, but the way in which 
that functionality is provided is up to the implementer. Figure 9.2 IPsec Architecture SPD

Security policy database SAD 9.2 / Ip Security Policy 311 ■ IPsec Protocol Mode: Tunnel, 
transport, or wildcard. ■ Path MTU: Any observed path maximum transmission unit 
(maximum size of a packet that can be transmitted without fragmentation) and aging 
variables (required for all implementations). The key management mechanism that is used 
to distribute keys is coupled to the authentication and privacy mechanisms only by way of 


## Page 7

the Security Parameters Index (SPI). Hence, authentication and privacy have been 
specified independent of any specific key management mechanism. IPsec provides the 
user with considerable flexibility in the way in which IPsec services are applied to IP 
traffic. As we will see later, SAs can be combined in a number of ways to yield the desired 
user configuration. Furthermore, IPsec provides a high degree of granularity in 
discriminating between traffic that is afforded IPsec protection and traffic that is allowed 
to bypass IPsec, as in the former case relating IP traffic to specific SAs. Security Policy 
Database The means by which IP traffic is related to specific SAs (or no SA in the case of 
traffic allowed to bypass IPsec) is the nominal Security Policy Database (SPD). In its 
simplest form, an SPD contains entries, each of which defines a subset of IP traffic and 
points to an SA for that traffic. In more complex environments, there may be multiple 
entries that potentially relate to a single SA or multiple SAs associated with a single SPD 
entry. The reader is referred to the relevant IPsec documents for a full discussion. Each 
SPD entry is defined by a set of IP and upper-layer protocol field values, called selectors. 
In effect, these selectors are used to filter outgoing traffic in order to map it into a 
particular SA. Outbound processing obeys the following general sequence for each IP 
packet. 1. Compare the values of the appropriate fields in the packet (the selector fields) 
against the SPD to find a matching SPD entry, which will point to zero or more SAs. 2. 
Determine the SA if any for this packet and its associated SPI. 3. Do the required IPsec 
processing (i.e., AH or ESP processing). The following selectors determine an SPD entry: ■ 
Remote IP Address: This may be a single IP address, an enumerated list or range of 
addresses, or a wildcard (mask) address. The latter two are required to support more than 
one destination system sharing the same SA (e.g., behind a firewall). ■ Local IP Address: 
This may be a single IP address, an enumerated list or range of addresses, or a wildcard 
(mask) address. The latter two are required to support more than one source system 
sharing the same SA (e.g., behind a firewall). ■ Next Layer Protocol: The IP protocol header 
(IPv4, IPv6, or IPv6 Extension) includes a field (Protocol for IPv4, Next Header for IPv6 or 
IPv6 Extension) that designates the protocol operating over IP. This is an individual 
protocol number, ANY, or for IPv6 only, OPAQUE. If AH or ESP is used, then this IP protocol 
header immediately precedes the AH or ESP header in the packet. 312 chapter 9 / IP 
Security ■ Name: A user identifier from the operating system. This is not a field in the IP or 
upper-layer headers but is available if IPsec is running on the same operating system as 
the user. ■ Local and Remote Ports: These may be individual TCP or UDP port values, an 
enumerated list of ports, or a wildcard port. Table 9.2 provides an example of an SPD on a 
host system (as opposed to a network system such as a firewall or router). This table 
reflects the following configuration: A local network configuration consists of two 
networks. The basic corporate network configuration has the IP network number 
1.2.3.0/24. The local configuration also includes a secure LAN, often known as a DMZ, that 
is identified as 1.2.4.0/24. The DMZ is protected from both the outside world and the rest of 
the corporate LAN by firewalls. The host in this example has the IP address 1.2.3.10, and it 
is authorized to connect to the server 1.2.4.10 in the DMZ. The entries in the SPD should be 
self-explanatory. For example, UDP port 500 is the designated port for IKE. Any traffic from 
the local host to a remote host for purposes of an IKE exchange bypasses the IPsec 
processing. IP Traffic Processing IPsec is executed on a packet-by-packet basis. When 
IPsec is implemented, each outbound IP packet is processed by the IPsec logic before 
transmission, and each inbound packet is processed by the IPsec logic after reception and 
before passing the packet contents on to the next higher layer (e.g., TCP or UDP). We look 
at the logic of these two situations in turn. Outbound Packets Figure 9.3 highlights the 


## Page 8

main elements of IPsec processing for outbound traffic. A block of data from a higher 
layer, such as TCP, is passed down to the IP layer and an IP packet is formed, consisting of 
an IP header and an IP body. Then the following steps occur: 1. IPsec searches the SPD for 
a match to this packet. 2. If no match is found, then the packet is discarded and an error 
message is generated. Protocol Local IP Port Remote IP Port Action Comment UDP 
1.2.3.101 500 * 500 BYPASS IKE ICMP 1.2.3.101 * * * BYPASS Error messages * 1.2.3.101 *

1.2.3.101 * * * BYPASS Internet Table 9.2 Host SPD Example 9.2 / Ip Security Policy 313 3. If 
a match is found, further processing is determined by the first matching entry in the SPD. If 
the policy for this packet is DISCARD, then the packet is discarded. If the policy is BYPASS, 
then there is no further IPsec processing; the packet is forwarded to the network for 
transmission. 4. If the policy is PROTECT, then a search is made of the SAD for a matching 
entry. If no entry is found, then IKE is invoked to create an SA with the appropriate keys and 
an entry is made in the SA. 5. The matching entry in the SAD determines the processing for 
this packet. Either encryption, authentication, or both can be performed, and either 
transport or tunnel mode can be used. The packet is then forwarded to the network for 
transmission. Inbound Packets Figure 9.4 highlights the main elements of IPsec 
processing for inbound traffic. An incoming IP packet triggers the IPsec processing. The 
following steps occur: 1. IPsec determines whether this is an unsecured IP packet or one 
that has ESP or AH headers/trailers, by examining the IP Protocol field (IPv4) or Next 
Header field (IPv6). Figure 9.3 Processing Model for Outbound Packets Search security 
policy database Search security association database Determine policy Outbound IP 
packet (e.g., from TCP or UDP) Discard packet No match found No match found Match 
found Match found DISCARD PROTECT BYPASS Forward packet via IP Internet key 
exchange Process (AH/ESP) 314 chapter 9 / IP Security 2. If the packet is unsecured, IPsec 
searches the SPD for a match to this packet. If the first matching entry has a policy of 
BYPASS, the IP header is processed and stripped off and the packet body is delivered to 
the next higher layer, such as TCP. If the first matching entry has a policy of PROTECT or 
DISCARD, or if there is no matching entry, the packet is discarded. 3. For a secured packet, 
IPsec searches the SAD. If no match is found, the packet is discarded. Otherwise, IPsec 
applies the appropriate ESP or AH processing. Then, the IP header is processed and 
stripped off and the packet body is delivered to the next higher layer, such as TCP. 9.3 
Encapsulating Security Payload ESP can be used to provide confidentiality, data origin 
authentication, connectionless integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence 
integrity), and (limited) traffic flow confidentiality. The set of services provided depends on 
options selected at the time of Security Association (SA) establishment and on the 
location of the implementation in a network topology. ESP can work with a variety of 
encryption and authentication algorithms, including authenticated encryption algorithms 
such as GCM. ESP Format Figure 9.5a shows the top-level format of an ESP packet. It 
contains the following fields. Figure 9.4 Processing Model for Inbound Packets Search

chapter 9 / IP Security When any combined mode algorithm is employed, the algorithm 
itself is expected to return both decrypted plaintext and a pass/fail indication for the 
integrity check. For combined mode algorithms, the ICV that would normally appear at the 
end of the ESP packet (when integrity is selected) may be omitted. When the ICV is omitted 
and integrity is selected, it is the responsibility of the combined mode algorithm to encode 
within the Payload Data an ICV-equivalent means of verifying the integrity of the packet. 
Two additional fields may be present in the payload (Figure 9.5b). An initialization value 
(IV), or nonce, is present if this is required by the encryption or authenticated encryption 
algorithm used for ESP. If tunnel mode is being used, then the IPsec implementation may 
add traffic flow confidentiality (TFC) padding after the Payload Data and before the 
Padding field, as explained subsequently. Encryption and Authentication Algorithms The 
Payload Data, Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields are encrypted by the ESP 
service. If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic 
synchronization data, such as an initialization vector (IV), then these data may be carried 
explicitly at the beginning of the Payload Data field. If included, an IV is usually not 
encrypted, although it is often referred to as being part of the ciphertext. The ICV field is 
optional. It is present only if the integrity service is selected and is provided by either a 
separate integrity algorithm or a combined mode algorithm that uses an ICV. The ICV is 
computed after the encryption is performed. This order of processing facilitates rapid 
detection and rejection of replayed or bogus packets by the receiver prior to decrypting the 
packet, hence potentially reducing the impact of denial of service (DoS) attacks. It also 
allows for the possibility of parallel processing of packets at the receiver that is decryption 
can take place in parallel with integrity checking. Note that because the ICV is not 
protected by encryption, a keyed integrity algorithm must be employed to compute the 
ICV. Padding The Padding field serves several purposes: ■ If an encryption algorithm 
requires the plaintext to be a multiple of some number of bytes (e.g., the multiple of a 
single block for a block cipher), the Padding field is used to expand the plaintext 
(consisting of the Payload Data, Padding, Pad Length, and Next Header fields) to the 
required length. ■ The ESP format requires that the Pad Length and Next Header fields be 
right aligned within a 32-bit word. Equivalently, the ciphertext must be an integer multiple 
of 32 bits. The Padding field is used to assure this alignment. ■ Additional padding may be 
added to provide partial traffic-flow confidentiality by concealing the actual length of the 
payload. Anti-Replay Service A replay attack is one in which an attacker obtains a copy of 
an authenticated packet and later transmits it to the intended destination. The receipt of 


## Page 10

duplicate, authenticated IP packets may disrupt service in some way or may have some 
other undesired consequence. The Sequence Number field is designed to thwart such 9.3 / 
Encapsulating Security Payload 317 attacks. First, we discuss sequence number 
generation by the sender, and then we look at how it is processed by the recipient. When a 
new SA is established, the sender initializes a sequence number counter to 0. Each time 
that a packet is sent on this SA, the sender increments the counter and places the value in 
the Sequence Number field. Thus, the first value to be used is 1. If anti-replay is enabled 
(the default), the sender must not allow the sequence number to cycle past 232 - 1 back to 
zero. Otherwise, there would be multiple valid packets with the same sequence number. If 
the limit of 232 - 1 is reached, the sender should terminate this SA and negotiate a new SA 
with a new key. Because IP is a connectionless, unreliable service, the protocol does not 
guarantee that packets will be delivered in order and does not guarantee that all packets 
will be delivered. Therefore, the IPsec authentication document dictates that the receiver 
should implement a window of size W, with a default of W = 64. The right edge of the 
window represents the highest sequence number, N, so far received for a valid packet. For 
any packet with a sequence number in the range from N - W + 1 to N that has been 
correctly received (i.e., properly authenticated), the corresponding slot in the window is 
marked (Figure 9.6). Inbound processing proceeds as follows when a packet is received: 1. 
If the received packet falls within the window and is new, the MAC is checked. If the 
packet is authenticated, the corresponding slot in the window is marked. 2. If the received 
packet is to the right of the window and is new, the MAC is checked. If the packet is 
authenticated, the window is advanced so that this sequence number is the right edge of 
the window, and the corresponding slot in the window is marked. 3. If the received packet 
is to the left of the window or if authentication fails, the packet is discarded; this is an 
auditable event. Transport and Tunnel Modes Figure 9.7 shows two ways in which the 
IPsec ESP service can be used. In the upper part of the figure, encryption (and optionally 
authentication) is provided directly between two hosts. Figure 9.7b shows how tunnel 
mode operation can be used to set up a virtual private network. In this example, an 
organization has four private networks Figure 9.6 Anti-replay Mechanism Fixed window

Security interconnected across the Internet. Hosts on the internal networks use the 
Internet for transport of data but do not interact with other Internet-based hosts. By 
terminating the tunnels at the security gateway to each internal network, the configuration 
allows the hosts to avoid implementing the security capability. The former technique is 
supported by a transport mode SA, while the latter technique uses a tunnel mode SA. In 
this section, we look at the scope of ESP for the two modes. The considerations are 
somewhat different for IPv4 and IPv6. We use the packet formats of Figure 9.8a as a 
starting point. Transport Mode ESP Transport mode ESP is used to encrypt and optionally 
authenticate the data carried by IP (e.g., a TCP segment), as shown in Figure 9.8b. For this 
mode using IPv4, the ESP header is inserted into the IP packet immediately prior to the 
transport-layer header (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), and an ESP trailer (Padding, Pad Length, and 
Next Header fields) is placed after the IP packet. If authentication is selected, the ESP 
Authentication Data field is added after the ESP trailer. The entire transport-level segment 
plus the ESP trailer are encrypted. Authentication covers all of the ciphertext plus the ESP 
header. In the context of IPv6, ESP is viewed as an end-to-end payload; that is, it is not 
examined or processed by intermediate routers. Therefore, the ESP header appears after 
the IPv6 base header and the hop-by-hop, routing, and fragment extension headers. The 


## Page 11

destination options extension header could appear before or after the ESP header, 
depending on the semantics desired. For IPv6, encryption covers Figure 9.7 Transport-

transport-level segment plus the ESP trailer plus the destination options extension header 
if it occurs after the ESP header. Again, authentication covers the ciphertext plus the ESP 
header. Transport mode operation may be summarized as follows. 1. At the source, the 
block of data consisting of the ESP trailer plus the entire transport-layer segment is 
encrypted and the plaintext of this block is replaced Figure 9.8 Scope of ESP Encryption

(a) Before Applying ESP 320 chapter 9 / IP Security with its ciphertext to form the IP packet 
for transmission. Authentication is added if this option is selected. 2. The packet is then 
routed to the destination. Each intermediate router needs to examine and process the IP 
header plus any plaintext IP extension headers but does not need to examine the 
ciphertext. 3. The destination node examines and processes the IP header plus any 
plaintext IP extension headers. Then, on the basis of the SPI in the ESP header, the 
destination node decrypts the remainder of the packet to recover the plaintext transport-
layer segment. Transport mode operation provides confidentiality for any application that 
uses it, thus avoiding the need to implement confidentiality in every individual application. 
One drawback to this mode is that it is possible to do traffic analysis on the transmitted 
packets. Tunnel Mode ESP Tunnel mode ESP is used to encrypt an entire IP packet 
(Figure 9.8c). For this mode, the ESP header is prefixed to the packet and then the packet 
plus the ESP trailer is encrypted. This method can be used to counter traffic analysis. 
Because the IP header contains the destination address and possibly source routing 
directives and hop-by-hop option information, it is not possible simply to transmit the 
encrypted IP packet prefixed by the ESP header. Intermediate routers would be unable to 
process such a packet. Therefore, it is necessary to encapsulate the entire block (ESP 
header plus ciphertext plus Authentication Data, if present) with a new IP header that will 
contain sufficient information for routing but not for traffic analysis. Whereas the 
transport mode is suitable for protecting connections between hosts that support the ESP 
feature, the tunnel mode is useful in a configuration that includes a firewall or other sort of 
security gateway that protects a trusted network from external networks. In this latter 
case, encryption occurs only between an external host and the security gateway or 
between two security gateways. This relieves hosts on the internal network of the 
processing burden of encryption and simplifies the key distribution task by reducing the 
number of needed keys. Further, it thwarts traffic analysis based on ultimate destination. 
Consider a case in which an external host wishes to communicate with a host on an 
internal network protected by a firewall, and in which ESP is implemented in the external 
host and the firewalls. The following steps occur for transfer of a transport-layer segment 
from the external host to the internal host. 1. The source prepares an inner IP packet with a 
destination address of the target internal host. This packet is prefixed by an ESP header; 


## Page 12

then the packet and ESP trailer are encrypted and Authentication Data may be added. The 
resulting block is encapsulated with a new IP header (base header plus optional 
extensions such as routing and hop-by-hop options for IPv6) whose destination address is 
the firewall; this forms the outer IP packet. 2. The outer packet is routed to the destination 
firewall. Each intermediate router needs to examine and process the outer IP header plus 
any outer IP extension headers but does not need to examine the ciphertext. 9.3 / 
Encapsulating Security Payload 321 3. The destination firewall examines and processes 
the outer IP header plus any outer IP extension headers. Then, on the basis of the SPI in the 
ESP header, the destination node decrypts the remainder of the packet to recover the 
plaintext inner IP packet. This packet is then transmitted in the internal network. 4. The 
inner packet is routed through zero or more routers in the internal network to the 
destination host. Figure 9.9 shows the protocol architecture for the two modes. Figure 9.9

IP IPsec IP 322 chapter 9 / IP Security 9.4 Combining Security Associations An individual SA 
can implement either the AH or ESP protocol but not both. Sometimes a particular traffic 
flow will call for the services provided by both AH and ESP. Further, a particular traffic flow 
may require IPsec services between hosts and, for that same flow, separate services 
between security gateways, such as firewalls. In all of these cases, multiple SAs must be 
employed for the same traffic flow to achieve the desired IPsec services. The term security 
association bundle refers to a sequence of SAs through which traffic must be processed to 
provide a desired set of IPsec services. The SAs in a bundle may terminate at different 
endpoints or at the same endpoints. Security associations may be combined into bundles 
in two ways: ■ Transport adjacency: Refers to applying more than one security protocol to 
the same IP packet without invoking tunneling. This approach to combining AH and ESP 
allows for only one level of combination; further nesting yields no added benefit since the 
processing is performed at one IPsec instance: the (ultimate) destination. ■ Iterated 
tunneling: Refers to the application of multiple layers of security protocols effected 
through IP tunneling. This approach allows for multiple levels of nesting, since each tunnel 
can originate or terminate at a different IPsec site along the path. The two approaches can 
be combined, for example, by having a transport SA between hosts travel part of the way 
through a tunnel SA between security gateways. One interesting issue that arises when 
considering SA bundles is the order in which authentication and encryption may be 
applied between a given pair of endpoints and the ways of doing so. We examine that issue 
next. Then we look at combinations of SAs that involve at least one tunnel. Authentication 
Plus Confidentiality Encryption and authentication can be combined in order to transmit 
an IP packet that has both confidentiality and authentication between hosts. We look at 
several approaches. ESP with Authentication Option This approach is illustrated in Figure 
9.8. In this approach, the user first applies ESP to the data to be protected and then 
appends the authentication data field. There are actually two subcases: ■ Transport mode 
ESP: Authentication and encryption apply to the IP payload delivered to the host, but the IP 
header is not protected. ■ Tunnel mode ESP: Authentication applies to the entire IP packet 
delivered to the outer IP destination address (e.g., a firewall), and authentication is 
performed at that destination. The entire inner IP packet is protected by the privacy 
mechanism for delivery to the inner IP destination. For both cases, authentication applies 
to the ciphertext rather than the plaintext. 9.4 / Combining Security Associations 323 


## Page 13

Transport Adjacency Another way to apply authentication after encryption is to use two 
bundled transport SAs, with the inner being an ESP SA and the outer being an AH SA. In this 
case, ESP is used without its authentication option. Because the inner SA is a transport SA, 
encryption is applied to the IP payload. The resulting packet consists of an IP header (and 
possibly IPv6 header extensions) followed by an ESP. AH is then applied in transport mode, 
so that authentication covers the ESP plus the original IP header (and extensions) except 
for mutable fields. The advantage of this approach over simply using a single ESP SA with 
the ESP authentication option is that the authentication covers more fields, including the 
source and destination IP addresses. The disadvantage is the overhead of two SAs versus 
one SA. Transport-Tunnel Bundle The use of authentication prior to encryption might be 
preferable for several reasons. First, because the authentication data are protected by 
encryption, it is impossible for anyone to intercept the message and alter the 
authentication data without detection. Second, it may be desirable to store the 
authentication information with the message at the destination for later reference. It is 
more convenient to do this if the authentication information applies to the unencrypted 
message; otherwise the message would have to be reencrypted to verify the 
authentication information. One approach to applying authentication before encryption 
between two hosts is to use a bundle consisting of an inner AH transport SA and an outer 
ESP tunnel SA. In this case, authentication is applied to the IP payload plus the IP header 
(and extensions) except for mutable fields. The resulting IP packet is then processed in 
tunnel mode by ESP; the result is that the entire, authenticated inner packet is encrypted 
and a new outer IP header (and extensions) is added. Basic Combinations of Security 
Associations The IPsec Architecture document lists four examples of combinations of SAs 
that must be supported by compliant IPsec hosts (e.g., workstation, server) or security 
gateways (e.g., firewall, router). These are illustrated in Figure 9.10. The lower part of each 
case in the figure represents the physical connectivity of the elements; the upper part 
represents logical connectivity via one or more nested SAs. Each SA can be either AH or 
ESP. For host-to-host SAs, the mode may be either transport or tunnel; otherwise it must 
be tunnel mode. Case 1. All security is provided between end systems that implement 
IPsec. For any two end systems to communicate via an SA, they must share the 
appropriate secret keys. Among the possible combinations are a. AH in transport mode b. 
ESP in transport mode c. ESP followed by AH in transport mode (an ESP SA inside an AH 
SA) d. Any one of a, b, or c inside an AH or ESP in tunnel mode We have already discussed 
how these various combinations can be used to support authentication, encryption, 
authentication before encryption, and authentication after encryption. 324 cha pter 9 / IP

Case 2. Security is provided only between gateways (routers, firewalls, etc.) and no hosts 
implement IPsec. This case illustrates simple virtual private network support. The security 
architecture document specifies that only a single tunnel SA is needed for this case. The 
tunnel could support AH, ESP, or ESP with the authentication option. Nested tunnels are 
not required, because the IPsec services apply to the entire inner packet. Case 3. This 
builds on case 2 by adding end-to-end security. The same combinations discussed for 
cases 1 and 2 are allowed here. The gateway-to-gateway tunnel provides either 


## Page 14

authentication, confidentiality, or both for all traffic between end systems. When the 
gateway-to-gateway tunnel is ESP, it also provides a limited form of traffic confidentiality. 
Individual hosts can implement any additional IPsec services required for given 
applications or given users by means of end-to-end SAs. Case 4. This provides support for 
a remote host that uses the Internet to reach an organization’s firewall and then to gain 
access to some server or workstation behind the firewall. Only tunnel mode is required 
between the remote host and the firewall. As in case 1, one or two SAs may be used 
between the remote host and the local host. 9.5 Internet Key Exchange The key 
management portion of IPsec involves the determination and distribution of secret keys. A 
typical requirement is four keys for communication between two applications: transmit 
and receive pairs for both integrity and confidentiality. The IPsec Architecture document 
mandates support for two types of key management: ■ Manual: A system administrator 
manually configures each system with its own keys and with the keys of other 
communicating systems. This is practical for small, relatively static environments. ■ 
Automated: An automated system enables the on-demand creation of keys for SAs and 
facilitates the use of keys in a large distributed system with an evolving configuration. The 
default automated key management protocol for IPsec is referred to as ISAKMP/Oakley 
and consists of the following elements: ■ Oakley Key Determination Protocol: Oakley is a 
key exchange protocol based on the Diffie–Hellman algorithm but providing added 
security. Oakley is generic in that it does not dictate specific formats. ■ Internet Security 
Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP): ISAKMP provides a framework for 
Internet key management and provides the specific protocol support, including formats, 
for negotiation of security attributes. ISAKMP by itself does not dictate a specific key 
exchange algorithm; rather, ISAKMP consists of a set of message types that enable the use 
of a variety of key exchange algorithms. Oakley is the specific key exchange algorithm 
mandated for use with the initial version of ISAKMP. 326 chapter 9 / IP Security In IKEv2, 
the terms Oakley and ISAKMP are no longer used, and there are significant differences 
from the use of Oakley and ISAKMP in IKEv1. Nevertheless, the basic functionality is the 
same. In this section, we describe the IKEv2 specification. Key Determination Protocol IKE 
key determination is a refinement of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm. Recall 
that Diffie–Hellman involves the following interaction between users A and B. There is 
prior agreement on two global parameters: q, a large prime number; and a, a primitive root 
of q. A selects a random integer XA as its private key and transmits to B its public key ΥA = 
aXA mod q. Similarly, B selects a random integer XB as its private key and transmits to A its 
public key ΥB = aXB mod q. Each side can now compute the secret session key: K = (ΥB) XA 
mod q = (ΥA) XB mod q = aXAXB mod q The Diffie–Hellman algorithm has two attractive 
features: ■ Secret keys are created only when needed. There is no need to store secret 
keys for a long period of time, exposing them to increased vulnerability. ■ The exchange 
requires no pre-existing infrastructure other than an agreement on the global parameters. 
However, there are a number of weaknesses to Diffie–Hellman, as pointed out in [HUIT98]. 
■ It does not provide any information about the identities of the parties. ■ It is subject to a 
man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party C impersonates B while communicating 
with A and impersonates A while communicating with B. Both A and B end up negotiating a 
key with C, which can then listen to and pass on traffic. The man-in-the-middle attack 
proceeds as 1. B sends his public key YB in a message addressed to A (see Figure 3.14). 2. 
The enemy (E) intercepts this message. E saves B’s public key and sends a message to A 
that has B’s User ID but E’s public key YE. This message is sent in such a way that it 
appears as though it was sent from B’s host system. A receives E’s message and stores E’s 


## Page 15

public key with B’s User ID. Similarly, E sends a message to B with E’s public key, 
purporting to come from A. 3. B computes a secret key K1 based on B’s private key and YE. 
A computes a secret key K2 based on A’s private key and YE. E computes K1 using E’s 
secret key XE and YB and computers K2 using XE and YA. 4. From now on, E is able to relay 
messages from A to B and from B to A, appropriately changing their encipherment en route 
in such a way that neither A nor B will know that they share their communication with E. ■ 
It is computationally intensive. As a result, it is vulnerable to a clogging attack, in which an 
opponent requests a high number of keys. The victim spends considerable computing 
resources doing useless modular exponentiation rather than real work. 9.5 / Internet Key 
Exchange 327 IKE key determination is designed to retain the advantages of Diffie–
Hellman, while countering its weaknesses. Features of IKE key determination The IKE key 
determination algorithm is characterized by five important features: 1. It employs a 
mechanism known as cookies to thwart clogging attacks. 2. It enables the two parties to 
negotiate a group; this, in essence, specifies the global parameters of the Diffie–Hellman 
key exchange. 3. It uses nonces to ensure against replay attacks. 4. It enables the 
exchange of Diffie–Hellman public key values. 5. It authenticates the Diffie–Hellman 
exchange to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks. We have already discussed Diffie–
Hellman. Let us look at the remainder of these elements in turn. First, consider the 
problem of clogging attacks. In this attack, an opponent forges the source address of a 
legitimate user and sends a public Diffie–Hellman key to the victim. The victim then 
performs a modular exponentiation to compute the secret key. Repeated messages of this 
type can clog the victim’s system with useless work. The cookie exchange requires that 
each side send a pseudorandom number, the cookie, in the initial message, which the 
other side acknowledges. This acknowledgment must be repeated in the first message of 
the Diffie–Hellman key exchange. If the source address was forged, the opponent gets no 
answer. Thus, an opponent can only force a user to generate acknowledgments and not to 
perform the Diffie–Hellman calculation. IKE mandates that cookie generation satisfy three 
basic requirements: 1. The cookie must depend on the specific parties. This prevents an 
attacker from obtaining a cookie using a real IP address and UDP port and then using it to 
swamp the victim with requests from randomly chosen IP addresses or ports. 2. It must 
not be possible for anyone other than the issuing entity to generate cookies that will be 
accepted by that entity. This implies that the issuing entity will use local secret 
information in the generation and subsequent verification of a cookie. It must not be 
possible to deduce this secret information from any particular cookie. The point of this 
requirement is that the issuing entity need not save copies of its cookies, which are then 
more vulnerable to discovery, but can verify an incoming cookie acknowledgment when it 
needs to. 3. The cookie generation and verification methods must be fast to thwart attacks 
intended to sabotage processor resources. The recommended method for creating the 
cookie is to perform a fast hash (e.g., MD5) over the IP Source and Destination addresses, 
the UDP Source and Destination ports, and a locally generated secret value. IKE key 
determination supports the use of different groups for the Diffie– Hellman key exchange. 
Each group includes the definition of the two global parameters and the identity of the 
algorithm. The current specification includes the following groups. 328 chapter 9 / IP

(hexadecimal): A = 0, Y = 1EE9 The first three groups are the classic Diffie–Hellman 
algorithm using modular exponentiation. The last two groups use the elliptic curve analog 
to Diffie–Hellman. IKE key determination employs nonces to ensure against replay 
attacks. Each nonce is a locally generated pseudorandom number. Nonces appear in 
responses and are encrypted during certain portions of the exchange to secure their use. 
Three different authentication methods can be used with IKE key determination: ■ Digital 
signatures: The exchange is authenticated by signing a mutually obtainable hash; each 
party encrypts the hash with its private key. The hash is generated over important 
parameters, such as user IDs and nonces. ■ Public-key encryption: The exchange is 
authenticated by encrypting parameters such as IDs and nonces with the sender’s private 
key. ■ Symmetric-key encryption: A key derived by some out-of-band mechanism can be 
used to authenticate the exchange by symmetric encryption of exchange parameters. 
IKEv2 Exchanges The IKEv2 protocol involves the exchange of messages in pairs. The first 
two pairs of exchanges are referred to as the initial exchanges (Figure  9.11a). In the first 
exchange, the two peers exchange information concerning cryptographic algorithms and 
other security parameters they are willing to use along with nonces and Diffie–Hellman 
(DH) values. The result of this exchange is to set up a special SA called the IKE SA (see 
Figure 9.2). This SA defines parameters for a secure channel between the peers over which 
subsequent message exchanges take place. Thus, all subsequent IKE message exchanges 
are protected by encryption and message authentication. In the second exchange, the two 
parties authenticate one another and set up a first IPsec SA to be placed in the SADB and 
used for 9.5 / Internet Key Exchange 329 Figure 9.11 IKEv2 Exchanges HDR, SAi1, KEi, Ni

exchange can be used to establish further SAs for protecting traffic. The informational 
exchange is used to exchange management information, IKEv2 error messages, and other 
notifications. Header and Payload Formats IKE defines procedures and packet formats to 
establish, negotiate, modify, and delete security associations. As part of SA 
establishment, IKE defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication 
data. These payload formats provide a consistent framework independent of the specific 
key exchange protocol, encryption algorithm, and authentication mechanism. IKE Header 
Format An IKE message consists of an IKE header followed by one or more payloads. All of 
this is carried in a transport protocol. The specification dictates that implementations 
must support the use of UDP for the transport protocol. 330 chapter 9 / IP Security Figure 
9.12a shows the header format for an IKE message. It consists of the following fields. ■ 
Initiator SPI (64 bits): A value chosen by the initiator to identify a unique IKE security 
association (SA). ■ Responder SPI (64 bits): A value chosen by the responder to identify a 
unique IKE SA. ■ Next Payload (8 bits): Indicates the type of the first payload in the 
message; payloads are discussed in the next subsection. ■ Major Version (4 bits): 


## Page 17

Indicates major version of IKE in use. ■ Minor Version (4 bits): Indicates minor version in 
use. ■ Exchange Type (8 bits): Indicates the type of exchange; these are discussed later in 
this section. ■ Flags (8 bits): Indicates specific options set for this IKE exchange. Three bits 
are defined so far. The initiator bit indicates whether this packet is sent by the SA initiator. 
The version bit indicates whether the transmitter is capable of using a higher major version 
number than the one currently indicated. The response bit indicates whether this is a 
response to a message containing the same message ID. ■ Message ID (32 bits): Used to 
control retransmission of lost packets and matching of requests and responses. ■ Length 
(32 bits): Length of total message (header plus all payloads) in octets. IKE Payload Types 
All IKE payloads begin with the same generic payload header shown in Figure 9.12b. The 
Next Payload field has a value of 0 if this is the last Figure 9.12 IKE Formats Next Payload

payload in the message; otherwise its value is the type of the next payload. The Payload 
Length field indicates the length in octets of this payload, including the generic payload 
header. The critical bit is 0 if the sender wants the recipient to skip this payload if it does 
not understand the payload type code in the Next Payload field of the previous payload. It 
is set to 1 if the sender wants the recipient to reject this entire message if it does not 
understand the payload type. Table 9.3 summarizes the payload types defined for IKE and 
lists the fields, or parameters, that are part of each payload. The SA payload is used to 
begin the establishment of an SA. The payload has a complex, hierarchical structure. The 
payload may contain multiple proposals. Each proposal may contain multiple protocols. 
Each protocol may contain multiple transforms. And each transform may contain multiple 
attributes. These elements are formatted as substructures within the payload as follows. 
■ Proposal: This substructure includes a proposal number, a protocol ID (AH, ESP, or IKE), 
an indicator of the number of transforms, and then a transform substructure. If more than 
one protocol is to be included in a proposal, then there is a subsequent proposal 
substructure with the same proposal number. ■ Transform: Different protocols support 
different transform types. The transforms are used primarily to define cryptographic 
algorithms to be used with a particular protocol. ■ Attribute: Each transform may include 
attributes that modify or complete the specification of the transform. An example is key 
length. 332 chapter 9 / IP Security The Key Exchange payload can be used for a variety of 
key exchange techniques, including Oakley, Diffie–Hellman, and the RSA-based key 
exchange used by PGP. The Key Exchange data field contains the data required to generate 
a session key and is dependent on the key exchange algorithm used. The Identification 
payload is used to determine the identity of communicating peers and may be used for 
determining authenticity of information. Typically the ID Data field will contain an IPv4 or 
IPv6 address. The Certificate payload transfers a public-key certificate. The Certificate 
Encoding field indicates the type of certificate or certificate-related information, which 


## Page 18

may include the following: ■ PKCS #7 wrapped X.509 certificate ■ PGP certificate ■ DNS 
signed key ■ X.509 certificate—signature ■ X.509 certificate—key exchange ■ Kerberos 
tokens ■ Certificate Revocation List (CRL) ■ Authority Revocation List (ARL) ■ SPKI 
certificate At any point in an IKE exchange, the sender may include a Certificate Request 
payload to request the certificate of the other communicating entity. The payload may list 
more than one certificate type that is acceptable and more than one certificate authority 
that is acceptable. The Authentication payload contains data used for message 
authentication purposes. The authentication method types so far defined are RSA digital 
signature, shared-key message integrity code, and DSS digital signature. The Nonce 
payload contains random data used to guarantee liveness during an exchange and to 
protect against replay attacks. The Notify payload contains either error or status 
information associated with this SA or this SA negotiation. The following table lists the IKE 
notify messages. Error Messages Status Messages Unsupported Critical Initial Contact

Internal Address Failure Failed CP Required TS Unacceptable Invalid Selectors The Delete 
payload indicates one or more SAs that the sender has deleted from its database and that 
therefore are no longer valid. The Vendor ID payload contains a vendor-defined constant. 
The constant is used by vendors to identify and recognize remote instances of their 
implementations. This mechanism allows a vendor to experiment with new features while 
maintaining backward compatibility. The Traffic Selector payload allows peers to identify 
packet flows for processing by IPsec services. The Encrypted payload contains other 
payloads in encrypted form. The encrypted payload format is similar to that of ESP. It may 
include an IV if the encryption algorithm requires it and an ICV if authentication is 
selected. The Configuration payload is used to exchange configuration information 
between IKE peers. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) payload allows IKE SAs to 
be authenticated using EAP, which was discussed in Chapter 5. 9.6 Cryptographic Suites 
The IPsecv3 and IKEv3 protocols rely on a variety of types of cryptographic algorithms. As 
we have seen in this book, there are many cryptographic algorithms of each type, each 
with a variety of parameters, such as key size. To promote interoperability, two RFCs 
define recommended suites of cryptographic algorithms and parameters for various 
applications. RFC 4308 defines two cryptographic suites for establishing virtual private 
networks. Suite VPN-A matches the commonly used corporate VPN security used in older 
IKEv1 implementations at the time of the issuance of IKEv2 in 2005. Suite VPN-B provides 
stronger security and is recommended for new VPNs that implement IPsecv3 and IKEv2. 
Table 9.4a lists the algorithms and parameters for the two suites. There are several points 
to note about these two suites. Note that for symmetric cryptography, 334 chapter 9 / IP 
Security VPN-A relies on 3DES and HMAC, while VPN-B relies exclusively on AES. Three 
types of secret-key algorithms are used: ■ Encryption: For encryption, the cipher block 
chaining (CBC) mode is used. ■ Message authentication: For message authentication, 
VPN-A relies on HMAC with SHA-1 with the output truncated to 96 bits. VPN-B relies on a 
variant of CMAC with the output truncated to 96 bits. ■ Pseudorandom function: IKEv2 
generates pseudorandom bits by repeated use of the MAC used for message 
authentication. RFC 6379 defines four optional cryptographic suites that are compatible 


## Page 19

with the United States National Security Agency’s Suite B specifications. In 2005, the NSA 
issued Suite B, which defined the algorithms and strengths needed to protect both 
sensitive but unclassified (SBU) and classified information for use in its Cryptographic 
Modernization program [LATT09]. The four suites defined in RFC 6379 provide choices for 
ESP and IKE. The four suites are differentiated by the choice of cryptographic algorithm 
strengths and a choice of whether ESP is to provide both confidentiality and integrity or 
integrity only. All of the suites offer greater protection than the two VPN suites defined in 
RFC 4308. VPN-A VPN-B ESP encryption 3DES-CBC AES-CBC (128-bit key) ESP integrity

/ Key Terms, Review Questions, And Problems 335 Key Terms Table 9.4b lists the 
algorithms and parameters for the two suites. As with RFC 4308, three categories of secret 
key algorithms are listed: ■ Encryption: For ESP, authenticated encryption is provided 
using the GCM mode with either 128-bit or 256-bit AES keys. For IKE encryption, CBC is 
used, as it was for the VPN suites. ■ Message authentication: For ESP, if only 
authentication is required, then a message authentication algorithm known as GMAC is 
used. For IKE, message authentication is provided using HMAC with one of the SHA-3 hash 
functions. ■ Pseudorandom function: As with the VPN suites, IKEv2 in these suites 
generates pseudorandom bits by repeated use of the MAC used for message 
authentication. For the Diffie–Hellman algorithm, the use of elliptic curve groups modulo a 
prime is specified. For authentication, elliptic curve digital signatures are listed. The 
original IKEv2 documents used RSA-based digital signatures. Equivalent or greater 
strength can be achieved using ECC with fewer key bits. 9.7 Key Terms, Review Questions,

each of the fields in the IPv4 header, indicate whether the field is immutable, mutable but 
predictable, or mutable (zeroed prior to ICV calculation). b. Do the same for the IPv6 
header. c. Do the same for the IPv6 extension headers. In each case, justify your decision

for each field. 9.5 Suppose that the current replay window spans from 120 to 530. a. If the 
next incoming authenticated packet has sequence number 340, what will the receiver do 
with the packet, and what will be the parameters of the window after that? b. If instead the 
next incoming authenticated packet has sequence number 598, what will the receiver do 
with the packet, and what will be the parameters of the window after that? c. If instead the 
next incoming authenticated packet has sequence number 110, what will the receiver do 
with the packet, and what will be the parameters of the window after that? 9.6 When 
tunnel mode is used, a new outer IP header is constructed. For both IPv4 and IPv6, indicate 
the relationship of each outer IP header field and each extension header in the outer 
packet to the corresponding field or extension header of the inner IP packet. That is, 
indicate which outer values are derived from inner values and which are constructed 
independently of the inner values. 9.7 End-to-end authentication and encryption are 
desired between two hosts. Draw figures similar to Figure 9.8 that show each of the 
following. a. Transport adjacency with encryption applied before authentication. b. A 
transport SA bundled inside a tunnel SA with encryption applied before authentication. c. 
A transport SA bundled inside a tunnel SA with authentication applied before encryption. 
9.8 The IPsec architecture document states that when two transport mode SAs are 
bundled to allow both AH and ESP protocols on the same end-to-end flow, only one 
ordering of security protocols seems appropriate: performing the ESP protocol before 
performing the AH protocol. Why is this approach recommended rather than 
authentication before encryption? 9.9 For the IKE key exchange, indicate which 
parameters in each message go in which ISAKMP payload types. 9.10 Where does IPsec

Security Chapter 338 chapter 10 / Malicious Software Malicious software, or malware, 
arguably constitutes one of the most significant categories of threats to computer 
systems. SP 800-83 (Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and 
Laptops, July 2013) defines malware as “a program that is covertly inserted into another 
program with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or 
otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, 
applications, or operating system.” Hence, we are concerned with the threat malware 
poses to application programs, to utility programs, such as editors and compilers, and to 
kernel-level programs. We are also concerned with its use on compromised or malicious 
Web sites and servers, or in especially crafted spam e-mails or other messages, which aim 
to trick users into revealing sensitive personal information. This chapter1 examines the 
wide spectrum of malware threats and countermeasures. We begin with a survey of 
various types of malware and offer a broad classification based first on the means 
malware uses to spread or propagate, and then on the variety of actions or payloads used 
once the malware has reached a target. Propagation mechanisms include those used by 
viruses, worms, and trojans. Payloads include system corruption, bots, phishing, spyware, 
and rootkits. The discussion then includes a review of countermeasure approaches. 
Finally, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are reviewed. 10.1 Types of Malicious
