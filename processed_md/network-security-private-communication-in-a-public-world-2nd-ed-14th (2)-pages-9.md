matter, however, and the PCBC check is more valuable there.) 11.12.2 Authenticators The 
authenticator is a piece of information included in a message at the start of a communication 
attempt between Alice and Bob which enables Alice and Bob to prove to each other that they 
are who they claim to be. It is encrypted with the session key Alice requested from the KDC for 
conversing with Bob. We will assume in the following that Alice is sending the authenticator to 
Bob. # octets ≤40 Alice’s name null-terminated ≤40 Alice’s instance null-terminated ≤40 Alice’s 
realm null-terminated 4 checksum 1 5-millisecond timestamp 4 timestamp ≤ 7 pad of 0s to 
make authenticator multiple of eight octets 288 KERBEROS V4 11.12.3 • ALICE’S 
NAME/INSTANCE/REALM. The presence of these fields avoids an extremely obscure threat. 
Without these fields, if two principals have the same master key, then an attacker who could 
intercept messages between one of them and the KDC could change the AS_REQ to have the 
other principal’s name. The returned ticket would then be for the other principal, so that when 
this principal used the ticket to Bob, Bob would believe it to be the other principal. Now you 
know. • CHECKSUM—four octets. This field can be used in an application-specific way. None of 
the applications that have been Kerberized use this field in a way in which the name checksum 
makes sense. Many applications set this field to Alice’s process id. The application that copies 
the KDC database to KDC replicas sets this field to the size of the KDC database. The sample 
application provided to help implementers build a Kerberized application suggests having the 
user type in a value for that field. • 5-MILLISECOND TIMESTAMP. This field extends the 
TIMESTAMP field to give time granularity down to 5 milliseconds instead of 1 second. Its 
purpose is to allow more than one authenticator to the same service to be generated in a single 
second without having it rejected as a duplicate. The simplest implementation of this field 
would actually be a sequence number within the second (in which case the name is misleading, 
since it has nothing to do with the unit of time of 5 milliseconds). • TIMESTAMP—four octets, 
time in seconds. This is really the main information in the authenticator. Bob decrypts the 
authenticator, verifies that the time is acceptably close to current, and, if mutual 
authentication is used, increments this field, encrypts the result, and sends it back to Alice. 
Because only Bob (or Alice) is able to encrypt the incremented value, when Alice verifies the 
response she knows that the authenticator arrived at Bob. 11.12.3 Credentials The 
CREDENTIALS field in a message is encrypted. When returned in an AS_REP (the message that 
returns a ticket-granting ticket), it is encrypted in Alice’s master key. When returned in a 
TGS_REP (the message which requests a ticket to another principal, from the Ticket-Granting 
Server), it is encrypted with Alice’s session key. 11.12.3 MESSAGE FORMATS 289 Again, we’re 
assuming Alice has requested to talk to Bob. • SESSION KEY—eight octets. In an AS_REP, this 
gives the login session key for Alice. In a TGS_REP, this gives the key to be used when Alice 
communicates with Bob. • BOB’S NAME/INSTANCE/REALM. These fields identify the ticket 
target. Since Alice sends the ticket request unprotected, the presence of these fields assures 
Alice that the ticket is for whom she thinks it is for. • TICKET LIFETIME—one octet. Number of 5-
minute intervals from the time in TIMESTAMP during which the ticket should be valid. • KEY 
VERSION NUMBER. This field allows Bob to change his key in a way that won’t disrupt principals 
that are currently talking to Bob or holding tickets for Bob. Bob must keep track of his old keys 
for 21 hours after he reports the new key to the KDC (or somewhat longer to allow for 
propagation to slave KDCs). All such active keys for Bob should have unique key version 
numbers. When a ticket arrives, Bob can use the key version number in the unencrypted header 
to decide which key to use to decrypt it. 21 hours after Bob reports a new key, any issued tickets 
encrypted under older keys will have expired and Bob can safely forget the older keys. • 
TIMESTAMP—four octets. Time when ticket generated. # octets 8 session key for Alice↔Bob

ask for a ticket (when one doesn’t already have a TGT). It is almost always used to ask for a TGT, 
which is a ticket to the Ticket-Granting Service. Theoretically it could be used to ask for a ticket 
to any service, using the requester’s master key. • MESSAGE TYPE. AS_REQ (1). • B BIT, BYTE-
ORDER FLAG. • ALICE’S TIMESTAMP. This field is here in order to help Alice match up requests 
with replies. • DESIRED TICKET LIFETIME—one octet. In units of 5 minutes, how long the 
requester would like the issued ticket to be good for. This was a mistake in the design—the 
upper bound (about 21 hours) is not long enough for some applications. • SERVICE’S NAME. For 
the normal case of a request for a ticket to the Ticket-Granting Service, the name will be the 
constant krbtgt. • SERVICE’S INSTANCE. For the normal case of a request for a ticket to the 
Ticket-Granting Service, the instance will be the realm name. 11.12.5 TGS_REQ The TGS_REQ is 
used by Alice to request a ticket to Bob from the TGS. In order to do this, Alice needs to send the 
TGS the TGT (so that the TGS can know the proper session key for Alice), and an # octets 1

MESSAGE FORMATS 291 authenticator. It turns out sending an authenticator in a TGS_REQ has 
no security value, but it is necessary in an AP_REQ, and therefore it is in the TGS_REQ to make 
the two protocols similar. • MESSAGE TYPE. AP_REQ (3). • KDC’S KEY VERSION NUMBER. 
Copied from BOB’S KEY VERSION NUMBER in the credentials which Alice obtained in the 
KRB_TGS_REP she received when she asked for a TGT. • KDC’S REALM. This field is here so that 
the KDC, in interrealm authentication, will know which key to use to decrypt the ticket. Suppose 
the KDC in realm B is registered in many different realms. The KDC in B will have a different key 
for each realm in which it is registered. For example, if realm B can talk to realm A, then B will 
have a master key stored at realm A’s KDC. If B can also talk to realm C, then B will have a 
different master key stored at realm C’s KDC. When Alice, in realm A, gets a ticket to the KDC in 
B, and then asks B for a ticket to a principal in B’s realm, it is necessary to inform B which key it 
should use to decrypt the ticket (in this case, the one it shares with the KDC in realm A). 11.12.6 
AS_REP and TGS_REP This message is the reply to an AS_REQ or a TGS_REQ. It’s really a single 
message type (2), but it can occur in response to two different sorts of request. # octets 1

fields, we’ll assume the reply is in response to a request from Alice to get a ticket for Bob. • 
MESSAGE TYPE. AS_REP (2). • ALICE’S NAME/INSTANCE/REALM. Useful in case there are 
multiple principals on the same node. If a response comes back, the service might not be able 
to know to which principal the credentials belongs without that field there. Given that the field 
is not encrypted, it has no security value. It is just there to prevent nonmalicious confusion. The 
MIT implementation ignores these fields. • ALICE’S TIMESTAMP. As sent in request (this is to 
match requests and replies). • NUMBER OF TICKETS—one octet. Ignored by Kerberos Version 4. 
In earlier versions of Kerberos, it was possible to request multiple tickets in a single request. 
Because this feature was never used and complicated the message formats, it was simplified 
out of V4. This field remains for backwards compatibility. • TICKET EXPIRATION TIME—four 
octets. • ALICE’S KEY VERSION—one octet. Unused if this message is in response to a 
TGS_REQ. • CREDENTIALS LENGTH—two octets. • CREDENTIALS. # octets 1 version of

11.12.7 MESSAGE FORMATS 293 11.12.7 Error Reply from KDC This message is in response to 
an AS_REQ or a TGS_REQ, if the KDC fails to reply with a ticket. Again, assume this is in 
response to principal Alice requesting a ticket for principal Bob. The defined values for error 
code are: 1—Alice’s database entry at the KDC expired. (Note: Kerberos allows database 
entries to expire. There is an expiration date on each entry.) 2—Bob’s database entry expired. 
3—authenticator on the request expired. 4—wrong protocol version number. 7—byte order 
unknown. (C’mon—it’s a bit! How can you not know the two values of a bit?!—and we left out 
errors 5 and 6 because they were even sillier, and they also were never invoked in the code, so 
they are irrelevant.) 8—Alice or Bob not found in database. 9—Alice or Bob found in multiple 
places in the database (though it seems like it would be more sensible to generate an error 
when adding a duplicate rather than checking for it on every read). 10—Alice or Bob found, but 
no key is in the database. 20—Generic error from KDC. 11.12.8 AP_REQ This message is sent 
from Alice to Bob early in their conversation in order to authenticate. Exactly how this message 
is passed within the application protocol is not defined by Kerberos. The receiv- # octets 1

end must be able to figure out that this is a Kerberos message and pass it to its own Kerberos 
subroutines. • BOB’S REALM. This is in case Bob is registered in different realms, with different 
keys in each one. This field enables Bob to choose the proper key to use to decrypt the ticket. 
11.12.9 AP_REP The Kerberos documentation does not define an explicit reply from Bob when 
Alice sends an AP_REQ. However, the library routines include subroutine krb_sendauth, used 
by Alice, and krb_recvauth, used by Bob, which most applications use. If all that is necessary is 
for Bob to authenticate Alice, then there is no necessity for a Kerberos reply from Bob. The 
application just starts conversing. If mutual authentication is desired, then Bob needs to send 
information to Alice that will prove that Bob has decrypted the ticket and therefore knows the 
session key. The Kerberos routine krb_recvauth accomplishes this by having Bob extract the 
value of the CHECKSUM field and increment it. The message format of the message sent by 
krb_recvauth is the same as KRB_PRV (described in following section), but the data part of the 
ENCRYPTED STUFF field is the four-octet incremented checksum. # octets 1 version of 
Kerberos (4) 1 message type (8) B 1 Bob’s key version number ≤40 Bob’s realm null-terminated

MESSAGE FORMATS 295 11.12.10 Encrypted Data (KRB_PRV) Some applications want privacy 
as well as authentication, i.e., they want their data encrypted. They call a Kerberos subroutine 
that encrypts the application-supplied data and packages it into a message of the following 
form: The ENCRYPTED STUFF is encrypted using DES in the PCBC mode using the session key. 
Once decrypted, its format is: By the nature of PCBC, the sender’s IP address and the 
timestamp serve as an integrity check on the data. The timestamp serves a second function of 
providing some protection against replay. Because encryption for privacy is an export-
controlled technology, certain versions of Kerberos exclude the capacity to encrypt application-
supplied data. This message type will still occur, however, in the context of a mutual 
authentication message. 11.12.11 Integrity-Checked Data (SAFE) For some applications, 
privacy of the data is not a concern, but protection of the integrity of the data in transit is. 
Others may be willing to give up privacy in order to get better performance or in order to satisfy 
government regulations, but are still willing to pay a price for integrity protection. # octets 1

timestamp variable padding 296 KERBEROS V4 11.12.11 The SAFE message is basically 
application data to which Kerberos appends a checksum and timestamp. The format for 
integrity-protected data is • SENDER’S IP ADDRESS. It does not appear that having this field in 
every message adds anything to security, but the Kerberos code checks that it matches the 
address from which the packet came. • TIMESTAMP. The purpose of this field is to prevent 
delayed and replayed messages. An application could save all timestamps that were used 
within the allowable clock skew and refuse additional messages with the same timestamp. It 
could also require that messages encrypted under a given key be processed in strictly 
ascending order by timestamp (if using a connection type that prevents reordering). All the 
Kerberos-V4-provided subroutine does is make sure the timestamp is within the allowable 
clock skew. • 5-MILLISECOND TIMESTAMP. This field allows more than one message within a 
second. Theoretically it is in units of 5 milliseconds, but in practice can be a sequence number 
of messages sent within a particular value of the four-octet TIMESTAMP field. If this format 
survives long enough, a limit of one message every 5 milliseconds may someday be a problem. 
• CHECKSUM. The modified Jueneman checksum is seeded with the session key as described 
in §11.10 Encryption for Integrity Only so that only someone with knowledge of the session key 
can compute a new valid checksum for a modified message. # octets 1 version of Kerberos (4) 1

11.12.12 AP_ERR This is returned if the authentication failed. The possible errors are 31—can’t 
decode authenticator. 32—ticket expired. 33—ticket not yet valid. 34—repeated request. 
Receiver of message remembers receiving the same timestamp and 5-millisecond timestamp 
before. 35—ticket isn’t for us. Well, we’re not sure what they intended by this error message, 
but it’s never used anywhere. The intention was most likely for Bob to check Bob’s name and 
instance inside the ticket, but none of the applications implemented actually check this. 36—
request is inconsistent. The name, instance, and realm of Bob as listed in the ticket does not 
match the name, instance, and realm in the authenticator. 37—delta_t too big. There is too 
much skew in the clocks. This is determined based on comparison of the timestamp in the 
authenticator and the local time at Bob. This skew can be set independently at each node, but a 
common time is five minutes. 38—incorrect net address. The address in the ticket does not 
match the source address in the Network Layer header of the received message. 39—protocol 
version number mismatch. 40—invalid message type. 41—message stream modified. Either 
the checksum failed or some other piece of bad formatting was detected in an encrypted or 
integrity-protected message. 42—message out of order. Timestamps are not in ascending 
order. This assumes the application is running over a reliable transport protocol (in this case, 
TCP), so that reordering is not due to the network. 43—unauthorized request. This is an 
application-specific complaint, i.e., it is not generated by Kerberos. It might be used by Bob to 
tell Alice that Alice is not authorized to use Bob. # octets 1 version of Kerberos (4) 1 message

KERBEROS V4 11.13 11.13 HOMEWORK 1. Design a variant of Kerberos in which the 
workstation generates a TGT. The TGT will be encrypted with the user’s master key rather than 
the KDC’s master key. How does this compare with standard Kerberos in terms of efficiency, 
security, etc.? What happens in each scheme if the user changes her password during a login 
session? 2. §11.5 Replicated KDCs explains that the KDC database isn’t encrypted as a unit. 
Rather each user’s master key is independently encrypted with the KDC master key. Suppose 
replication were done with a simple download (i.e., no cryptographic integrity check is 
performed). How could a bad guy who is a principal registered with a KDC impersonate Alice, 


## Page 5

another principal registered with that KDC? Assume he can see and modify the KDC database 
in transit, but that he does not know the KDC master key. 3. Why is the authenticator field not of 
security benefit when asking the KDC for a ticket for Bob, but useful when logging into Bob? 4. 
Specify the Kerberos messages involved from the time a user first walks up to a workstation to 
the time the user is successfully talking to something in another realm. 5. With CBC, if one 
ciphertext block is lost, how many plaintext blocks are lost? With PCBC, why do things get back 
in sync if cn and cn+1 are switched? How about if a ciphertext block is lost? How about if 
ciphertext block n is switched with ciphertext block n+2? How about any permutation of the first 
n blocks? 299 12 KERBEROS V5 This chapter describes Kerberos Version 5, but it assumes you 
already understand Kerberos V4. So even if you think you’re only interested in V5, it’s a good 
idea to read the previous chapter first. Kerberos V5 represents a major overhaul of Version 4. 
While the basic philosophy remains the same, there are major changes to the encodings and 
major extensions to the functionality. The motivation behind the changes in Kerberos V5 is to 
allow greater flexibility in the environments in which Kerberos can be used. 12.1 ASN.1 ASN.1 
[ISO87, PISC93] is a data representation language standardized by ISO. It looks very similar to 
data structure definitions in programming languages. ASN.1 is popular among spec writers and 
standards bodies because it gives people a way to precisely define data structures without 
worrying about different data representations, such as bit and octet order, on different 
machines. Where Kerberos V4 messages had a largely fixed layout with variable-length fields 
marked in an ad hoc way, Kerberos V5 uses ASN.1 syntax with the Basic Encoding Rules (BER), 
which makes it easy for fields to be optional, of varying length, and tagged with type information 
to allow future versions to include additional encodings. This flexibility comes with a price. 
ASN.1 has a lot of overhead. It adds octets of overhead in databases and octets on the wire, 
and increases the complexity of the code. Often when people define things in ASN.1, they don’t 
realize what the actual format will be. It is possible to use ASN.1 in a way that would create less 
overhead, but that takes expertise in ASN.1, and there are very few security protocol designers 
who have any interest in the specifics of ASN.1. To illustrate the point, in Kerberos V4 an 
address is four octets. Admittedly this is not sufficiently flexible, since it assumes IP addresses. 
Had the Kerberos designers custom-designed a more flexible address format, they’d probably 
have designed something like • a one-octet address type (defining type codes for IP and 
perhaps DECnet, CLNP, IPX, and Appletalk) 300 KERBEROS V5 12.1 • a one-octet length, 
specifying the length in octets of the address (this is needed because some address types, for 
instance CLNP, are variable-length) • and then the address. With this format it would have 
taken six octets to encode an IP address, rather than four in Kerberos V4. However, Kerberos V5 
defines an address using the ASN.1 definition: HostAddress ::= SEQUENCE { addr-type[0] 
INTEGER, address[1] OCTET STRING } What does this mean? It means that an address has two 
components: addr-type and address. That sounds reasonable. But what does the Kerberos V5 
definition of an address actually expand into? Somehow it adds 11 octets of overhead to each 
address, meaning that encoding an IP address in V5 requires 15 octets instead of V4’s four 
octets. Where does this 11 octet overhead come from? The construct SEQUENCE requires an 
octet to specify that it’s a sequence, and an octet to specify the length of the entire sequence. 
The first component, addr-type[0] INTEGER, requires four octets of overhead in addition to the 
singleoctet integer that specifies the type of address: • addr-type[0] requires an octet to specify 
that it’s type 0, then an octet to specify the length of what follows. • INTEGER requires a 
minimum of three octets: an octet to specify that it’s an integer (TYPE), an octet to specify how 
many octets (LENGTH) of integer, and at least one octet giving the value of the integer. Similarly, 
the next component, address[1] OCTET STRING, requires four octets of overhead in addition to 
the actual address. With clever use of ASN.1, it would have been possible to reduce the 


## Page 6

overhead substantially. For instance, by defining things with IMPLICIT, the representations are 
more compact, because then the TYPE and LENGTH fields do not appear. For example, four 
octets of overhead are avoided by defining an address as follows: HostAddress ::= SEQUENCE { 
addr-type[0] IMPLICIT INTEGER, address[1] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING } The above definition 
would reduce the overhead from 11 octets to 7 octets. An ASN.1 guru might define an address 
as follows: HostAddress ::= CHOICE { ip_address[0] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING, clnp_address[1] 
IMPLICIT OCTET STRING, 12.2 NAMES 301 ipx_address[2] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING, …} That 
definition produces only two octets of overhead for an address (provided that the world doesn’t 
invent more than 64 types of address), since it expands into a type (the number in square 
brackets), followed by a length, followed by the address. Because ASN.1 is ugly to look at, and 
since the actual octet-expansion is pretty much irrelevant to any reader of this book, when we 
describe message formats and data structures in Kerberos V5 we’ll just list the contents 
without being specific about the exact encoding. In Kerberos V4, the B BIT in all the messages 
specifies the octet order of multi-octet fields. In V5, fields are described using ASN.1 syntax, 
which defines a canonical format for integers. This is an example where use of ASN.1 hides the 
complexity of the protocol, since ASN.1 ensures a canonical format. 12.2 NAMES In Kerberos 
V4, a principal is named by the three fields NAME, INSTANCE, and REALM, which must each be 
a null-terminated text string up to 40 characters long (including the null). The size of these fields 
is too short for some environments, and certain characters (like “.”) are illegal inside Kerberos 
strings but required for account names on some systems. In V5, there are two components: the 
REALM and the NAME. The NAME component contains a type and a varying number of arbitrary 
strings, so the purpose served by the V4 INSTANCE field is accomplished by using an extra 
string in the NAME component. In V4, REALMs are DNS standard names, whereas in V5 they 
can be DNS standard names or X.500 names, and the syntax allows for other name types as 
well. 12.3 DELEGATION OF RIGHTS Delegation of rights is the ability to give someone else 
access to things you are authorized to access. Usually delegation is limited in time (Alice allows 
Bob to access her resources only for a specified amount of time), or limited in scope (Alice only 
allows Bob to access a specified subset of her resources). Why would Alice want to let Bob use 
her resources? Alice might want to start up a batch job on some remote node Bob that will run 
in the middle of the night and need to access 302 KERBEROS V5 12.3 many of her files located 
around the network. Or Alice might be logged into host Bob but then want to log into host 
Earnest from Bob. One way delegation could be provided is for Alice to send Bob her master key 
(in an encrypted message to Bob), allowing him to obtain tickets to whatever resources he 
might need on Alice’s behalf. That is clearly not desirable, since it would allow Bob to forever be 
able to impersonate Alice. You might think that if Alice knew what resources Bob would need to 
access on her behalf, she could obtain tickets for those resources in advance and send Bob the 
tickets and keys (in an encrypted message to Bob). Or if she didn’t know all the resources in 
advance, she could give Bob her TGT and session key, which he could use to obtain specific 
tickets on Alice’s behalf as necessary. Not only are these mechanisms inconvenient and/or 
insecure and therefore undesirable, but they wouldn’t work with Kerberos (either V4 or V5) 
because the ticket contains a network layer address, and Kerberos insists that a ticket must be 
used from the specified network layer address. In V4, the network layer address in the ticket is 
the address from which the ticket was requested. Kerberos V5 explicitly allows delegation by 
allowing Alice to ask for a TGT with a network layer address different from hers. As a matter of 
fact it allows Alice to specify multiple addresses to include (in which case the ticket can be 
used from any of the specified addresses), or allows Alice to request that no address be 
included (in which case the ticket can be used from any address). Alice logs in as in Kerberos 
V4, getting a session key and a TGT with her own network layer address. When she later decides 


## Page 7

that she needs to allow Bob to act on her behalf, she requests a new TGT from the KDC, but this 
time specifically says that she’d like the network layer address in the TGT to be Bob’s address. 
The new TGT so obtained is not usable by Alice directly, but can be passed to node Bob (along 
with the corresponding session key). It is a policy decision by the KDC as to whether to issue 
tickets with no specified address. It’s also a policy decision by services on the network as to 
whether to accept such tickets. Kerberos could have provided delegation by removing the 
network layer address from tickets and TGTs and instead having the network layer address in 
the authenticator. The Kerberos method has the disadvantage and advantage that Alice has to 
do an extra interaction with the KDC. It’s a disadvantage for performance reasons. But it’s an 
advantage because requiring Alice to do something that lets the KDC know she’s delegating to 
Bob enables the KDC to audit delegation events. In the event of a security compromise, the 
audit trail will tell which nodes had access to which resources. Sometimes Alice might know 
enough and be sufficiently security-conscious to specify the range of rights she wishes to 
delegate to Bob. Kerberos V5 supports two forms of limited delegation: • Alice can give Bob 
tickets to the specific services he will need to access on her behalf (rather than giving him a 
TGT, which would allow him to request tickets to any services). • When requesting a ticket or 
TGT that she intends to give to Bob, Alice can request that a field AUTHORIZATION-DATA be 
added to the ticket or TGT. The field is not interpreted by Ker- 12.3 DELEGATION OF RIGHTS 303 
beros, but is instead application-specific, which means it is left up to the application to define 
and use the field. The intention is that the field specifies to the application restrictions on what 
Bob is allowed to do with the ticket. If the field is in a TGT Alice gives to Bob, the field will be 
copied by the KDC into any ticket Bob gets using that TGT. OSF/DCE security (see §21.6 DCE 
Security) and Windows 2000 (see §21.7.2 Windows 2000 Kerberos) make extensive use of this 
field. Because there is not universal agreement that allowing delegation is always a good idea, 
Kerberos V5 makes it optional. A flag inside a TGT indicates whether a request for a TGT or ticket 
with a different network layer address should be allowed. The Kerberos protocol itself does not 
specify how the KDC should know how to set the various permission flags when creating an 
initial TGT. One method is the method the MIT implementation chose, which is to configure 
instructions for setting the permissions into the user’s entry in the KDC database. Another 
possible way of deciding how to set various flags inside the TGT would be to ask the user Alice 
when she logs in, but that leaves the potential for a horrible user interface: Name Password 
Proxiable? (Y/N) Allow postdated? (Y/N) Forwardable? (Y/N) Renewable? (Y/N) Aisle/Window 
Smoking/Nonsmoking …. There are two flags in a TGT involving delegation permission. One 
indicates that the TGT is forwardable, which means that it can be exchanged for a TGT with a 
different network layer address. This gives Alice permission to give Bob a TGT, with which Bob 
can request tickets to any resources on Alice’s behalf. When Alice uses a forwardable TGT to 
request a TGT to be used from Bob’s network layer address, she also specifies how the 
FORWARDABLE flag should be set in the requested TGT. If she requests that the TGT have the 
FORWARDABLE flag set, then Bob will be able to use that TGT to obtain a TGT for some other 
entity Carol, allowing Carol to act on Alice’s behalf. The other flag indicates that the TGT is 
proxiable, meaning that it can be used to request tickets for use with a different network layer 
address than the one in the TGT. This gives Alice permission to get tickets that she can give to 
Bob, but not a TGT for use by Bob. The Kerberos documentation refers to tickets Alice gives to 
Bob for use on her behalf as proxy tickets. TGTs have a FORWARDED flag. Tickets have a 
FORWARDED flag and a PROXY flag. A TGT given to Bob by Alice is marked forwarded. The 
FORWARDED flag will also be set in any ticket Bob obtains using a TGT marked forwarded. A 
ticket given to Bob by Alice is marked proxy. The reason for marking tickets in this way is that 
some applications may want to refuse to honor delegated tickets, and need to recognize them

as such. Note that allowing both the KDC and applications to make decisions on whether 
delegation is allowed makes for a flexible but confusing access control model. 304 KERBEROS 
V5 12.4 12.4 TICKET LIFETIMES In V4, the maximum lifetime of a ticket was about 21 hours, 
since the time in a ticket was encoded as a four-octet start time and a one-octet lifetime (in 
units of 5 minutes). This was too short for some applications. In Kerberos V5, tickets can be 
issued with virtually unlimited lifetimes (the farthest in the future that can be specified with a V5 
timestamp is Dec 31, 9999). The timestamp format is an ASN.1-defined quantity that is 17 
octets long. Although it has a virtually unlimited lifetime (unlike the V4 timestamp), it is only in 
seconds, and Kerberos V5, in some cases, would have preferred time expressed down to 
microseconds. As a result, much of the time when Kerberos V5 passes around a timestamp it 
also passes around a microsecond time, which is an ASN.1 integer whose representation 
requires sufficiently many octets to express the value (in this case one to three octets, since 
999999 is the biggest value), plus a type and length. Long-lived tickets pose serious security 
risks, because once created they cannot be revoked (except perhaps by invalidating the master 
key of the service to which the ticket was granted). So V5 has a number of mechanisms for 
implementing revocable long-lived tickets. These mechanisms involve use of several 
timestamp fields in tickets (and TGTs). Each timestamp is encoded, using glorious ASN.1 
format, in 17 octets of information. First we’ll give the names of the timestamps, and then we’ll 
explain how they’re used: • START-TIME—time the ticket becomes valid. • END-TIME—time the 
ticket expires. • AUTHTIME—time at which Alice first logged in, i.e., when she was granted an 
initial TGT (one based on her password). AUTHTIME is copied from her initial TGT into each 
ticket she requests based on that TGT. • RENEW-TILL—latest legal end-time (relevant for 
renewable tickets, see below). 12.4.1 Renewable Tickets Rather than creating a ticket valid for 
say, 100 years, the KDC can give Alice a ticket that will be valid for 100 years, but only if she 
keeps renewing it, say once a day. Renewing a ticket involves giving the ticket to the KDC and 
having the KDC reissue it. If there is some reason to want to revoke Alice’s privileges, this can 
be done by telling the KDC not to renew any of Alice’s tickets. The KDC is configured with a 
maximum validity time for a ticket, say a day. If there is a reason for Alice’s ticket to be valid for 
longer than that time, then when Alice requests the ticket, the KDC sets the RENEWABLE flag 
inside the ticket. The RENEW-TILL time specifies the time beyond which the ticket cannot be 
renewed. 12.4.2 TICKET LIFETIMES 305 In order to keep using the ticket, Alice will have to keep 
renewing it before it expires. If she is ever late renewing it, the KDC will refuse to renew it. Why 
did Kerberos choose to do it that way? It seems somewhat inconvenient. Node Alice has to 
keep a demon running checking for tickets that will expire soon, and renew them. If Kerberos 
allowed renewal of expired tickets, then Alice could wait until she attempts to use a ticket and 
gets an error message indicating the ticket expired, and then renew it. This would be more 
convenient. The reasoning in Kerberos is that if Alice could present a ticket a long time after it 
expired, then if the KDC has been told to revoke the ticket it would have to remember the 
revoked ticket until that ticket’s RENEW-TILL time. As it is, it just has to remember the revoked 
ticket for a maximum validity time. The END-TIME specifies the time at which the ticket will 
expire (unless renewed). When Alice gives the KDC a renewable ticket and requests that it be 
renewed, the KDC does this by changing END-TIME to be the maximum ticket lifetime as 
configured into the user’s entry in the KDC database, added to the current time (but not greater 
than RENEW-TILL). 12.4.2 Postdated Tickets Postdated tickets are used to run a batch job at 
some time in the future. Suppose you want to issue a ticket starting a week from now and good 
for two hours. One possible method is to issue a ticket with an expiration time of one week plus 
two hours from the present time, but that would mean the ticket would be valid from the time it 
was issued until it expired. Kerberos instead allows a ticket to become valid at some point in 


## Page 9

the future. Kerberos does this by using the START-TIME timestamp, indicating when the ticket 
should first become valid. Such a ticket is known as a postdated ticket. In order to allow 
revocation of the postdated ticket between the time it was issued and the time it becomes 
valid, there’s an INVALID flag inside the ticket that Kerberos sets in the initially issued 
postdated ticket. When the time specified in START-TIME occurs, Alice can present the ticket to 
the KDC and the KDC will clear the INVALID flag. This additional step gives the opportunity to 
revoke the postdated ticket by warning the KDC. If the KDC is configured to revoke the 
postdated ticket, the validation request will fail. There’s an additional flag inside the ticket, the 
POSTDATED flag, which indicates that the ticket was originally issued as a postdated ticket. An 
application could in theory refuse to accept such a ticket, but none currently do and we can’t 
imagine why any applications would care. A flag, MAY-POSTDATE, which appears in a TGT, 
indicates whether the KDC is allowed to issue postdated tickets using this TGT. 306 KERBEROS 
V5 12.5 12.5 KEY VERSIONS If Alice holds a ticket to Bob and then Bob changes his key, 
Kerberos enables Alice’s ticket to work until it expires by maintaining multiple versions of Bob’s 
key, and tagging Bob’s key with a version number where necessary for the KDC or for Bob to 
know which key to use. In the KDC database, each version of Bob’s key is stored as a triple: 
〈key, p_kvno, k_kvno〉. key is Bob’s key encrypted according to the KDC’s key. p_kvno is the 
version number of this key of Bob’s (p_ stands for principal). k_kvno is the version number of the 
KDC’s key that was used to encrypt key, since the KDC might also have changed its key recently 
(k_ stands for KDC). If Alice asks for a ticket to Bob, the KDC encrypts the ticket with the key for 
Bob with the highest p_kvno. In V4, the KDC did not keep track of more than one key for Bob. It 
was up to Bob to keep track of all his keys for a ticket expiration interval, in order for Bob to 
honor unexpired tickets issued with his old key. So why does the KDC need to keep track of 
multiple keys for Bob in V5? It is because of renewable tickets and postdated tickets. If Alice 
has a renewable ticket to Bob, and Bob changed his key since the ticket was originally issued, 
the KDC needs to be able to decrypt the ticket, so it needs to have stored the key with which 
that ticket was encrypted. When the KDC renews the ticket, it will issue the renewed ticket with 
the most recent key for Bob. That way the KDC and Bob can forget old key version numbers after 
a predictable, reasonably small time (like a day) (except for postdated tickets, which is 
somewhat of a design flaw in Kerberos). 12.6 MAKING MASTER KEYS IN DIFFERENT REALMS 
DIFFERENT Suppose Alice is registered in different realms, and suppose Alice is human. Given 
that humans have a limited capacity for remembering passwords, Alice might wish to have a 
single password in all the realms in which she is registered. This means that if an intruder 
discovers her master key in one realm, he can impersonate her in the other realms as well. In 
Kerberos V5, the password-to-key conversion hash function uses the realm name. This means 
that the function, given the same password, will come up with a different master key if the 
name of the realm is different. The function is such that it is not possible to derive the master 
key in realm FOO even if the master key derived from the same password in realm BAR is 
known. This does not protect against an intruder who manages to obtain Alice’s password. This 
just helps in the case where Alice has chosen a good password and an intruder manages to 
steal a KDC database from some realm. Stealing that database will allow the intruder to 
impersonate Alice in that realm, but not to impersonate Alice in any other realms for which she 
is using the same password. Note that stealing the database will also allow an intruder to 
mount an off-line password- 12.7 OPTIMIZATIONS 307 guessing attack, and if the password-
guessing attack succeeds, then the intruder can impersonate Alice in other realms for which 
she is using the same password. 12.7 OPTIMIZATIONS There were certain fields in Kerberos V4 
that were not necessary and were taken out in V5. In particular, encryption is expensive 
(especially when done in software), so it is undesirable to unnecessarily encrypt information. In 


## Page 10

Kerberos V4, a ticket is included in the CREDENTIALS portion of an AS_REP, and the entire 
CREDENTIALS field, including the ticket, is encrypted. A ticket is already an encrypted message. 
There is no reason to encrypt the ticket an additional time. (It had better not be necessary—
tickets are later sent across the network unencrypted.) An example of a field that was removed 
in Kerberos V5 because it was only slightly useful (if at all) was the name of the ticket target 
inside a ticket; that is, if Alice gets a ticket to Bob, then Bob’s name is in the V4 ticket to Bob, 
but not in the V5 ticket. 12.8 CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS Kerberos V4 assumes DES is the 
encryption algorithm. There are two problems with DES. One is that it is not secure enough for 
high-security environments. The other is that it is considered by the U.S. government to be too 
secure to export. Kerberos V5 is designed in a modular way which allows insertion of different 
encryption algorithms. When encryption is used, there is a type field allowing the receiver to 
know which decryption algorithm to use. Since different encryption systems use different-
length keys, and since some encryption systems allow variable-length keys, in V5 keys are 
tagged with a type and length. DES continues to be used in all actual implementations of 
Kerberos (to our knowledge). Two cryptographic weaknesses in Kerberos V4 (modified 
Jueneman checksum, which was used for integrity protection without encryption, and PCBC, 
which was used for encryption and integrity protection) were repaired. 308 KERBEROS V5 
12.8.1 12.8.1 Integrity-Only Algorithms The modified Jueneman checksum used in Kerberos V4, 
while never (publicly) broken, was not considered sufficiently secure (see §11.10 Encryption for 
Integrity Only). So in V5 it was replaced by a choice of algorithms. Why did V5 not simply choose 
one known-to-be-secure integrity protection algorithm? No algorithm is ever known to be 
secure. It’s just not known to be broken. So V5 selected a few algorithms, with the intent that if 
a serious cryptographic flaw was found in one of the algorithms being used, a different one 
could be substituted without changing the rest of the implementation. Unfortunately, if a 
recipient does not accept all defined algorithms, there is a possibility of non-interoperability 
(acceptable algorithms are not negotiated). Another problem with having a choice of algorithms 
is that Kerberos is really only as secure as the weakest algorithm the recipient will accept rather 
than the strongest. The reason for this is that if one algorithm is weak, then even if your 
implementation does not transmit it, a forger could use the weak algorithm to impersonate you 
to any implementation which accepts it. If Kerberos V5 were designed today, the algorithms of 
choice would probably be AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA-1. Kerberos V5 does something probably 
equivalent in terms of security, but harder to explain. Much harder to explain, as a matter of 
fact. We agonized as to whether to bother you with the details. The algorithms are baroque and 
technically uninteresting. There never would be a reason to implement them except to be 
compatible with a Kerberos V5 implementation. But in the interest of completeness, we’ll 
explain them here. Kerberos V5 documentation refers to an integrity check as a checksum. We 
prefer the term MAC (message authentication code). The MACs specified in V5 are as follows, 
using the names in the Kerberos documentation. Three of them are required to be supported by 
implementations. The other two are optional. • rsa-md5-des (required) • des-mac (required) • 
des-mac-k (required) • rsa-md4-des (optional) • rsa-md4-des-k (optional) 12.8.1.1 rsa-md5-des 
This MAC is one of the required ones. The name is not particularly helpful, except that it’s a 
combination of md5 and des. It has nothing to do with RSA other than that RSADSI (the 
company) owns rights to MD5, which is freely distributable provided that RSADSI is credited 
with every mention of it (or some such legalism). 12.8.1.2 CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS 309 
The way the MAC is calculated is as follows: 1. Choose a 64-bit random number, known as a 
confounder. 2. Prepend it to the message: 3. Calculate the MD5 message digest of the result, 
getting a 128-bit quantity. 4. Prepend the confounder chosen in Step 1 to the message digest: 5. 
Calculate a modified key by taking the KDC-supplied shared secret key and ⊕ing it with 


## Page 11

F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F016. Call the result K′. 6. Encrypt the result, using DES in CBC mode, using K′ 
and an IV (initialization vector) of 0, resulting in a 192-bit encrypted quantity. That 192-bit 
quantity is the MAC. How is this MAC verified? It’s actually quite straightforward. You just 
reverse all the steps. 1. Calculate the modified key, by performing Step 5 above (⊕ing the KDC-
supplied shared secret key with F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F016 to get K′). 2. Decrypt the MAC, using K′ in 
CBC mode, resulting in a 192-bit quantity. Let’s call the first 64 bits of the decrypted quantity X, 
and the remainder Y: 3. The first 64 bits of the result (X) should be the confounder. To verify that, 
append X to the message, and calculate the MD5 message digest of the result. 4. If the 128-bit 
result matches Y, then the MAC is verified as valid. 12.8.1.2 des-mac This is another of the 
required MACs. To calculate it do the following: 1. Choose a 64-bit random number, known as a 
confounder. confounder message 64 bits 128 bits confounder message digest 64 bits 128 bits X 
Y X message 310 KERBEROS V5 12.8.1.3 2. Prepend it to the message: 3. Calculate the DES 
CBC residue of the result (confounder prepended to the message) using the unmodified KDC-
supplied shared secret key K, and using an IV of 0. The result is a 64- bit quantity we’ll call R, for 
the Residue. 4. Calculate the modified key K′ = K ⊕ F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F016. 5. Prepend the 64-
bit confounder C to the 64-bit residue R, getting a 128-bit value. 6. Perform DES encryption in 
CBC mode on the 128-bit C|R from the previous step, using K′ as the key, and an IV of 0. 7. The 
result is the 128-bit MAC. Verifying this MAC is straightforward (see Homework Problem 9). 
12.8.1.3 des-mac-k This is another of the MACs which are required. The MACs that end with “-
k” in their name are the old-style ones, before it occurred to the Kerberos designers that using a 
modified key would be a good idea. These are no longer recommended, but need to be 
implemented for backward compatibility. This MAC is calculated by doing a CBC-residue over 
the message using the original key K, and using K also as the IV. The MAC is verified the same 
way. 12.8.1.4 rsa-md4-des This MAC is the same as rsa-md5-des, except that MD4 is used 
instead of MD5. 12.8.1.5 rsa-md4-des-k This MAC is no longer recommended, and is only there 
for backward compatibility. Again, the “-k” in the name indicates that it was designed before 
the Kerberos designers realized it would be a good idea to use a modified version of the key for 
calculating the MAC. This MAC is calculated as follows. First calculate MD4 of the message, 
yielding 128 bits (16 octets). Take the result and encrypt it using DES in CBC mode, with the 
unmodified session key K used as both the encryption key and the IV. The 128-bit result of the 
encryption is the MAC. confounder message 12.8.2 HIERARCHY OF REALMS 311 12.8.2 
Encryption for Privacy and Integrity The algorithms in this section provide encryption and 
integrity protection. The idea is to have an algorithm that not only encrypts the data, but allows 
Kerberos, when decrypting it, to detect if the message has been altered since being transmitted 
by the source. The three algorithms are known in the Kerberos documentation as des-cbc-crc, 
des-cbcmd4, and des-cbc-md5. The basic idea is that a checksum is combined with the 
message, and then the message is encrypted with DES in CBC mode. The algorithms use the 
checksums CRC-32, MD4, and MD5, respectively. All the algorithms do the following: 1. 
Choose a 64-bit random number known in the Kerberos documentation as a confounder. 2. 
Create the following data structure, where the field CHECKSUM is filled with zeroes and is of 
the right length for the checksum algorithm of choice (32 bits for des-cbc-crc and 128 bits for 
the others): 3. Calculate the appropriate checksum over the above data structure. 4. Fill in the 
result in the CHECKSUM field 5. Add enough padding to make the data structure an integral 
number of 64-bit chunks: 6. Encrypt the result using DES in CBC mode with an IV of 0. 12.9 
HIERARCHY OF REALMS In Kerberos V4, in order for principals in realm A to be authenticated by 
principals in realm B it was necessary for B’s KDC to be registered as a principal in A’s KDC. For 
full connectivity, this means that if there are n realms, the KDC in each realm has to be 
registered as a principal in each of the other n−1 realms. This is increasingly nightmarish as n 


## Page 12

gets large (see §7.7.4.1 Multiple KDC Domains). In Kerberos V5, it is allowable to go through a 
series of realms in order to authenticate. For instance, a principal in realm A might wish to be 
authenticated by a principal in realm C. However, realm C might not be registered in A. But 
perhaps realm B is registered in A, and realm C is regisconfounder checksum message 
confounder checksum message padding 312 KERBEROS V5 12.9 tered in B. A principal in A can 
get a ticket for something in C by first getting a ticket for B, and then asking B for a ticket to the 
KDC in C. By allowing realm B to act as intermediary between realm C and other realms, we give 
the KDC at B the power to impersonate anyone in the world. Kerberos fixes this vulnerability 
somewhat by including in tickets a TRANSITED field which lists the names of all the realms that 
have been transited to obtain the ticket. Why is the TRANSITED field useful? Suppose 
Woodward@Washington-Post.Com is contacted with a ticket that indicates the ticket was 
issued to the principal named DeepThroat@WhiteHouse.gov, with the TRANSITED field 
indicating KGB.Russia. It is possible that Woodward should not assume the party using the 
ticket is really Mr. or Ms. Throat, since it would be in the interest of and the ability of the owner 
of the KGB realm’s KDC to create a ticket that claims the source is anything. The KGB KDC can 
give such a ticket, along with the corresponding session key, to a confederate. Or the KDC can 
use the ticket and session key to impersonate the named source directly. The only thing the 
KGB KDC cannot do is avoid being named inside the ticket, since a KDC will reject a ticket if the 
final entry in the TRANSITED field doesn’t match the key with which the ticket is encrypted. If 
Alice gives Bob a ticket, Bob knows which KDC issued the ticket (it’s the one with which he 
shares the key used to encrypt the ticket). But for all the other information in the ticket (like 
Alice’s name and the other realms mentioned in the TRANSITED field), Bob has to trust the KDC 
which issued the ticket. And although the KDC which issued the ticket to Bob might be 
trustworthy, if there’s any KDC in the path that isn’t, all the earlier realms mentioned in the 
TRANSITED field and the original principal’s name (Alice) are suspect. The TRANSITED field in 
the ticket gives enough information for Bob (the service being accessed with the ticket) to know 
whether there are any realms on the path that Bob considers untrustworthy. A realm might be 
considered completely untrustworthy as a transit realm, but trustworthy when it claims to be 
acting on behalf of principals in its own realm. Each principal will have its own policy for which 
realms to trust. You could say that by doing this, Kerberos is permitting maximum flexibility in 
possible policies. Or you could say that Kerberos is abdicating responsibility for this crucial 
decision by throwing it to the whim of application developers who will almost certainly get it 
wrong. Either way, some sort of policy is necessary. One such policy—and a likely one at that—
is to arrange realms into a tree such that each realm shares a key with each of its children and 
with its parent. The set of realms trusted for any authentication is the shortest path through the 
tree, i.e., the A B C D E F G J H I 12.9 HIERARCHY OF REALMS 313 path that gets no closer to the 
root than the common ancestor lowest in the tree. For example, in the above diagram, realm G 
shares a key with its parent realm (C) and each of its children (H and I). To get from realm I to 
realm H, you’d go through G. To get from realm F to realm D, you’d go through the lowest 
common ancestor (B), and to get there you’d have to go through E, so the path would be F–E–B–
D. It’s especially convenient if the path of realms can be identified solely on the basis of the 
syntax of names. If realm names were just unstructured strings, it would be difficult to find a 
path. Luckily realm names in all current implementations of Kerberos are hierarchical, since 
they follow either Internet or X.500 naming. For instance, assume Cat@Hat.Com wishes to 
access Dennis@Menace.Com. Cat@Hat.Com resides in realm Hat.Com. 
Dennis@Menace.Com resides in Menace.Com. The next level of hierarchy is simply called 
Com. If we create a realm named Com that shares a key with all realms with names of the form 
x.Com, it can then serve as an authentication intermediary. In general, to get from one realm to 


## Page 13

another, one travels upward to a common ancestor, and then downward to the destination 
realm. It is likely that some administrative entity exists which would be a likely CA operator for 
the Com realm, because some such entity must ensure that there are no name collisions in the 
.Com space. Sometimes it might be desirable to shortcut the hierarchy. This might be for 
efficiency reasons (so authentication between two realms distant in the naming hierarchy does 
not need to be done via a long sequence of KDCs), or for trust reasons (there might be KDCs 
along the naming hierarchy path that the two realms would prefer not to have to trust). It is 
possible to have links between KDCs that wouldn’t ordinarily be linked based on the naming 
hierarchy. Such links are usually called cross-links. A safe rule with cross-links is that when 
traversing the naming hierarchy to get to the target, cross-links should always be used if they 
make the path shorter, because it means fewer KDCs need to be trusted. There are two issues 
with realm paths. One is how the initiator finds a realm path to the target. As we’ve shown, if 
names are hierarchical and the path of realms follows the same hierarchy, Com Hat.Com 
Menace.Com X.Y.Z Y.Z Z B.Z A.B.Z No shortcut link Shortcut link X.Y.Z Y.Z Z B.Z A.B.Z 314 
KERBEROS V5 12.10 with the possible addition of cross-links, it is easy to find a path. The other 
issue is how the target decides whether the realm path used was acceptable. As we said, 
Kerberos leaves it up to the application. The TRANSITED field lists the sequence of transited 
realms, omitting the source and destination realms. Realm names are listed separated by 
commas. Since the list of realms might get large, Kerberos permits various abbreviations. If the 
realm list is empty, no realms were transited. But if the realm list consists of a single comma, it 
means that the hierarchy of realms was transited in the normal way (parent to parent from the 
source up to the first common ancestor, then child to child down to the destination). Two 
consecutive commas in a list (or a leading or trailing comma) indicate that the hierarchy was 
transited in the normal way between the two realms surrounding the comma pair (or between 
source realm and first-listed realm, or between last-listed realm and destination realm). There 
are other abbreviation rules as well. 12.10 EVADING PASSWORD-GUESSING ATTACKS With 
Kerberos V4, there is no authentication of the request to the KDC for a TGT. Anyone can send a 
cleartext message to the KDC requesting a TGT for user Pope@Vatican.Com, and the KDC will 
send back a ticket, encrypted according to Pope’s master key. Since the function that maps a 
password string to a DES key is publicly known, an intruder can use the encrypted credentials 
for an off-line password-guessing attack to find Pope’s password. To avoid this attack, a 
mechanism has been added to Kerberos V5 in which information known as 
PREAUTHENTICATION-DATA can be sent along with the request for a TGT for user Pope which 
proves that the requester knew user Pope’s master key. The preauthentication data consists of 
a current timestamp encrypted with user Pope’s master key. There’s another opportunity for 
password guessing. Although the preauthentication data forces Alice to prove she knows user 
Pope’s master key before she can obtain a TGT for Pope, she can use her own TGT or master key 
to ask for a ticket to the principal named Pope. She’ll get back a quantity (the ticket to user 
Pope encrypted according to Pope’s master key) which she can use for an off-line password-
guessing attack to find Pope’s password. Kerberos prevents this attack by marking database 
entries for human users (such as Pope), with a flag indicating that the KDC should not issue a 
ticket to this principal. This prevents someone from obtaining a ticket for something whose 
master key is derived from a password (and therefore vulnerable to password guessing). If, in 
the future, Kerberos is used for an application where it might make sense to create a ticket to a 
human user (for instance, electronic mail), then some other mechanism would need to be 
devised to prevent Alice from guessing passwords based on tickets she requests (see 
Homework Problem 5). 12.11 KEY INSIDE AUTHENTICATOR 315 This does not avoid password-
guessing attacks completely. Someone can still guess passwords by constructing a request to 


## Page 14

the KDC for each password guess, and eventually one will be accepted. If passwords are even 
moderately well chosen, however, this is likely to be a very timeconsuming task. Furthermore, a 
KDC could include code to record the frequency of wrong password guesses and lock the target 
account and/or alert an administrator should a threshold be exceeded. A more important 
attack is that an eavesdropper who sees the initial Kerberos login exchange can perform an off-
line password guessing attack using either the preauthentication data provided by the user or 
the TGT sent in response. 12.11 KEY INSIDE AUTHENTICATOR Suppose Alice wants to have two 
separate conversations with Bob. If she uses the same key (the Alice-Bob session key chosen 
by the KDC) for both conversations, then theoretically an intruder could swap the data from one 
conversation with the other, and confuse Alice and Bob. Alice could get two tickets for Bob, but 
instead, Kerberos allows Alice to choose a different key for a particular conversation and put 
that into the authenticator. If the authenticator has a session key that Alice inserted, Bob will 
use the Alice-Bob session key to decrypt the authenticator, but will use the session key Alice 
put into the authenticator in that conversation with Alice. 12.12 DOUBLE TGT AUTHENTICATION 
Suppose Alice needs to access service Bob, but Bob does not know his master key. We’ll 
assume Bob used his master key to obtain a TGT and session key, and then forgot his master 
key. Usually, if Alice asks for a ticket to Bob, the KDC will give her a ticket encrypted with Bob’s 
master key. But Bob will not be able to decrypt the ticket, since Bob no longer knows his master 
key. If Bob is a user at a workstation, the workstation could at this point prompt Bob to type in 
his password again, but this would be inconvenient for the user. Kerberos assumes Alice knows 
that Bob is the type of thing who is unlikely to know his own master key. In a method 
unspecified in Kerberos, Alice is supposed to ask Bob for his TGT. Alice then sends Bob’s TGT as 
well as her own TGT to the KDC. (Hence the name double TGT authentication). Since Bob’s TGT 
is encrypted under a key that is private to the KDC, the KDC can decrypt it. It then issues a ticket 
to Bob for Alice which is encrypted with Bob’s session key rather than Bob’s master key. 316 
KERBEROS V5 12.13 The application which inspired this bit of the design was XWINDOWS. 
XWINDOWS clients and servers are backwards from what one might have guessed. The 
XWINDOWS server is the process that controls the user’s screen. XWINDOWS clients are 
applications that make requests to the server to open windows and display information. While 
the user of an XWINDOWS terminal may need to authenticate himself to some remote 
application in order to start it, that application must authenticate itself to the XWINDOWS 
server to get permission to display its output. The human, Bob, logs into a workstation. The 
workstation then gets a TGT and session key on behalf of Bob and then promptly forgets Bob’s 
master key. The application which is writing onto Bob’s workstation must authenticate itself to 
the workstation. Since the workstation has no credentials other than Bob’s TGT and session 
key, only a double TGT authentication as described above can work. 12.13 PKINIT—PUBLIC 
KEYS FOR USERS The design center for Kerberos is users with passwords and servers with high-
quality secret keys shared with the KDC. There have been various efforts since at least 1990 to 
allow use of a public key infrastructure as an alternative to passwords for authenticating users. 
The dream of every user having a public/private key pair—preferably stored on a smart card—
has been no more than a few years off for all of that time, but it continues to elude us. PKINIT 
would provide the bridge between public key enabled users and legacy servers that know only 
secret key technology. Servers don’t know or care how a user authenticated to a KDC. They only 
see the resulting ticket, which vouches for the user’s name. If a user had a private key and a 
certificate and obtained a TGT or Ticket from a KDC using a public key authentication protocol, 
this could be transparent and backwards compatible with existing servers. This is the exchange 
PKINIT defines. The simplest form of PKI integration that Kerberos could have defined would be 
for the KDC to list the user’s public key in its database instead of the user’s password. The 


## Page 15

TGS_REP message could then have been sent to the user encrypted under that public key. It 
would also have to be signed by the KDC with some public key the user could verify—otherwise 
the user could be tricked by someone impersonating the KDC and subsequently impersonating 
other servers. This simple construction was one of the early proposals, but it did not survive ten 
years of committee deliberations. Recall that there was a period from April 29, 1997 and 
September 20, 2000 when the patent on Diffie-Hellman had expired but the patent on RSA had 
not. During that period, there was an effort in the IETF to mandate use of unencumbered 
algorithms even if they were not technically appropriate. The suite pushed during that period 
was using DSS for signatures and Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for encryption. So PKINIT was 
transformed to mandate that the ticket request be 12.14 KDC DATABASE 317 signed and the 
reply be encrypted because that is what those algorithms required. Use of RSA is still allowed, 
but the optimization of allowing only a single private key operation on the client and being 
independent of PKI was not reinstated. There is a structural similarity between using a series of 
KDCs to authenticate and having a chain of certificates in a PKI. In each case, a set of 
intermediaries is being trusted. In each case, the decision of which intermediaries should be 
trusted to authenticate which identities to one another could be configured either into the 
infrastructure itself (possibly using name constraint rules) or into each endpoint. Kerberos 
chose to leave that decision to the endpoints. To be consistent with that decision, a Kerberos 
KDC makes no judgement as to whether a particular chain of certificates is acceptable. 
Instead, it confirms that it knows (has configured) the name and public key of the first CA in the 
chain, and lists that and all subsequent CAs as transited realms in the issued ticket. While this 
leaves maximum flexibility to the configuration of the server, it means that it is unlikely that 
PKINIT meet its original goal of connecting public key enabled clients to existing Kerberos 
enabled servers without requiring reconfiguration of the server. PKINIT does allow (but does not 
require) a translation table in a KDC so that the client name sent to the server can be a familiar 
Kerberos name rather than the X.500 name taken from the client’s certificate. 12.14 KDC 
DATABASE Each entry in the V5 KDC database contains the following information. The structure 
of the database is somewhat implementation-specific, but since all current implementations 
are derived from the MIT implementation, we describe the MIT implementation. • name—name 
of principal • key—principal’s master key • p_kvno—principal’s key version number. If this 
principal has k different valid keys, there will be k database entries for this principal. This could 
have been done more compactly by allowing multiple 〈key, p_kvno, k_kvno〉 entries per 
database. • max_life—maximum lifetime for tickets issued to this principal • 
max_renewable_life—maximum total lifetime for renewable tickets to this principal • k_kvno—
KDC key version under which key is encrypted • expiration—time when this database entry 
expires • mod_date—time of last modification to this entry 318 KERBEROS V5 12.15 • 
mod_name—name of the principal who made the last modification to this entry • flags 
indicating the KDC’s policy on various things; for instance, whether to require preauthentication 
data, whether to allow certain types of tickets such as forwardable, renewable, proxiable, 
postdated, and so on • password expiration—time when password expires. This is used to force 
the user to change passwords occasionally. • last_pwd_change—time when user last changed 
password • last_success—time of last successful user login (i.e., last AS_REQ with correct 
preauthentication data) 12.15 KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES Given that the Kerberos V5 messages 
are defined in ASN.1 notation, it isn’t useful to show exact message formats. We will instead 
just list the information in each of the messages. 12.15.1 Authenticator The authenticator is not 
a free-standing message, but rather is contained in a TGS_REQ or an AP_REQ. The entire thing is 
encrypted, using the key in the ticket that always accompanies an authenticator. Assume the 
authenticator is being sent in a message transmitted by Alice. When decrypted, the 


## Page 16

authenticator contains the following fields: AUTHENTICATOR-VNO version number (5) CNAME, 
CREALM Alice’s name and realm CKSUM (optional) checksum of application data that might 
have been sent along with the AP_REQ CTIME, CUSEC time at Alice (in seconds, microseconds) 
SUBKEY (optional) key Alice would like to use instead of the key in the ticket, for the 
conversation with Bob SEQ-NUMBER initial sequence number that Alice will use in her 
KRB_SAFE and KRB_PROT messages to Bob AUTHORIZATION-DATA application-specific data 
limiting Alice’s rights 12.15.2 KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES 319 12.15.2 Ticket A ticket is not a free-
standing message, but is rather carried in messages such as TGS_REQ, AS_REP, TGS_REP, 
AP_REQ, and KRB_CRED. A ticket given to Alice for use with Bob looks like this: 12.15.3 AS_REQ 
An AS_REQ is used to request a TGT. It can also be used to ask for regular tickets, but tickets 
requested with an AS_REQ (as opposed to a TGS_REQ) will return credentials encrypted with 
the requester’s master key. The TGS_REQ contains a TGT, and the credentials returned in 
response to a TGS_REQ are encrypted according to the session key in the TGT. Let’s assume 
that the request is on behalf of Alice in Wonderland. Let’s assume she’s asking for either a TGT 
or a ticket to Bob. MSG-TYPE message type (1) TKT-VNO protocol version number (5) REALM, 
SNAME Bob’s name and realm The remainder of the fields are encrypted with Bob’s master key 
(unless this ticket was obtained using Bob’s TGT as in §12.12 Double TGT Authentication): 
FLAGS FORWARDABLE, FORWARDED, PROXIABLE, PROXY, MAY-POSTDATE, POSTDATED, 
INVALID, RENEWABLE, INITIAL (ticket was issued using AS_REQ rather than TGS_REQ) PRE-
AUTHENT (user authenticated himself to the KDC before the ticket was issued) HW-AUTHENT 
(user was authenticated before ticket issued, using something like a smart card) KEY key to be 
used when communicating with Alice CNAME, CREALM Alice’s name and realm TRANSITED 
names of realms transited between Alice’s realm and Bob’s realm AUTH-TIME, START-TIME, 
END-TIME, RENEW-TILL timestamps. START-TIME and RENEW-TILL are optional. Described in 
§12.4 Ticket Lifetimes. CADDR (optional) the set of addresses from which this ticket will be 
valid AUTHORIZATION-DATA application-specific data limiting Alice’s rights 320 KERBEROS V5 
12.15.3 The flags that make sense in an AS_REQ are: • FORWARDABLE—Please set the 
FORWARDABLE flag in the returned TGT (so that the TGT can later be sent back to the KDC to 
request a TGT with a different network layer address inside). • PROXIABLE—Please set the 
PROXIABLE flag in the returned TGT (so that the TGT can be used to request a ticket with a 
different network layer address inside). • ALLOW-POSTDATE—Please set the ALLOW-
POSTDATE flag in the returned TGT (so that this TGT can be used to request postdated tickets). • 
POSTDATED—Make the returned ticket or TGT postdated, using the START-TIME in the request. 
Note that the START-TIME is an optional field, and it probably would have been more elegant to 
merely assume, if the requester included a START-TIME, that the requester wanted the ticket to 
be a postdated ticket. But the way Kerberos is defined, if the requester includes a START-TIME 
and does not set the POSTDATED flag, then the START-TIME is ignored and an ordinary, non-
postdated ticket is returned. • RENEWABLE—Please set the RENEWABLE flag in the returned 
ticket or TGT. • RENEWABLE-OK—The requester wants a ticket with a long lifetime. If the KDC is 
not willing to issue a ticket with that long a lifetime, the requester is willing to settle for a 
renewable ticket with an initial expiration time as far in the future as the KDC is willing to issue 
and renewable until the requested expiration time. MSG-TYPE message type (10) PVNO 
protocol version number (5) PADATA (optional) preauthentication data—timestamp encrypted 
with Alice’s master key KDC-OPTIONS flags—each flag indicates a request to set the 
corresponding flag in the ticket the KDC will return (see below) CNAME Alice’s name (the “c” 
comes from “client”) SNAME Bob’s name (or the name krbtgt if the request is for a TGT) REALM 
realm in which both Alice and Bob reside FROM (postdated ticket) desired start-time TILL 
desired end-time, which is the expiration time in the ticket RTIME desired renew-till time (only in

Alice would like KDC to use when encrypting the credentials ADDRESSES network layer 
addresses to include in ticket—used in proxy or forwardable tickets, or when Alice has multiple 
network layer addresses 12.15.4 KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES 321 12.15.4 TGS_REQ A TGS_REQ is 
used to request either a TGT or a ticket. The differences between a TGS_REQ and an AS_REQ 
are: • The TGS_REQ contains a TGT or a renewable or postdated ticket (the AS_REQ does not). • 
The TGS_REQ includes an authenticator in its PADATA field, proving the requester knows the 
key contained in the TGT or ticket in the request. The AS_REQ contains an encrypted timestamp 
in its optional PADATA field, proving the requester knows Alice’s master key. • The reply to a 
TGS_REQ is usually encrypted with the key inside the TGT or ticket enclosed with the request. 
However, if the authenticator contains a different key (called a subkey), the reply is encrypted 
with the subkey inside the authenticator. In contrast, the reply to an AS_REQ is always 
encrypted with the requester’s master key. MSG-TYPE message type (12) PVNO protocol 
version number (5) PADATA ticket and authenticator KDC-OPTIONS flags from AS_REQ, plus a 
few more explained above SNAME (or the name krbtgt if the request is for a TGT) REALM realm 
in which Bob resides (Alice might reside in a differerent realm in the case of a TGS_REQ) FROM 
(postdated ticket) desired start-time TILL desired end-time, which is the expiration time in the 
ticket RTIME desired renew-till time (only in request for renewable ticket) NONCE number to be 
returned in the reply to prevent replay attacks (MIT implementation uses current timestamp as 
the nonce) ETYPE type of encryption Alice would like KDC to use when encrypting the 
credentials ADDRESSES network layer addresses to include in ticket—used in proxy or 
forwardable tickets, or when Alice has multiple network layer addresses AUTHORIZATION-
DATA application specific data to be copied into TGT and tickets requested using that TGT, 
intended to convey restrictions on use. Note that this field is encrypted and integrity-protected. 
ADDITIONAL-TICKETS Bob’s TGT in the case where Bob does not know his master key (see 
§12.12 Double TGT Authentication) 322 KERBEROS V5 12.15.5 • There are more flags that might 
be relevant in a TGS_REQ. All the flags applicable to an AS_REQ are applicable to a TGS_REQ. In 
addition, the following flags are applicable in a TGS_REQ: ♦ FORWARDED—A list of addresses 
appears in the request which is different than the list of addresses (if any) that appears in the 
ticket. The list in the request should be included in the returned ticket, and the FORWARDED 
flag should be set in the returned ticket. ♦ PROXY—Same as FORWARDED, except this flag is 
used when requesting a TGT. ♦ ENC-TKT-IN-SKEY—Included in this request is Bob’s TGT (see 
§12.12 Double TGT Authentication). ♦ RENEW—Please renew the enclosed ticket. ♦ 
VALIDATE—Please validate the enclosed postdated ticket. • The AS_REQ contains the field 
CNAME, which does not appear in a TGS_REQ. It is not needed in the TGS_REQ because the 
KDC obtains the name of the requester from inside the ticket or TGT enclosed with the 
TGS_REQ. • The TGS_REQ contains the field AUTHORIZATION-DATA, and the AS_REQ does not. 
This field is supposed to be copied from the request into the ticket or TGT returned with the 
reply. It’s actually somewhat of a nuisance that Kerberos does not allow this field in an AS_REQ. 
If you want a TGT or ticket with AUTHORIZATION-DATA, then you have to first obtain a TGT 
without that field, and then use that TGT in a TGS_REQ to request a TGT with AUTHORIZATION-
DATA. Note that in order to prevent an intruder from modifying AUTHORIZATION-DATA in the 
request on its way to the KDC, the field is encrypted and integrity-protected with the key in the 
enclosed ticket or TGT, or if a subkey is present in the authenticator, then it’s encrypted with 
that subkey. Note that AUTHORIZATION-DATA is treated differently than the other fields in the 
request, such as Bob’s name, which are sent unencrypted and without integrity protection. 


## Page 18

Alice knows those other fields arrived intact because they are encrypted and integrity-protected 
when the KDC returns the credentials to Alice. • The TGS_REQ also contains the field 
ADDITIONAL-TICKETS, which if ENC-TKT-IN-SKEY is set in the KDC-OPTIONS field in the 
TGS_REQ, contains Bob’s TGT. 12.15.5 AS_REP An AS_REP is the reply from the KDC to an 
AS_REQ. It returns a TGT or ticket. In practice, PADATA is absent, indicating that the salt to be 
used is the user’s name and realm. If a different salt is specified, it is not possible to transmit 
PADATA in the AS_REQ, because the user’s master key would not be known. 12.15.5 KERBEROS 
V5 MESSAGES 323 Kerberos does provide mechanisms for recovery in case Alice’s workstation 
does not know the proper value of salt. One plausible reason why Alice’s workstation would not 
know the salt is that the realm name has changed since Alice last set her password. If the 
workstation has the wrong salt value, it will supply an incorrect value for PADATA in the request, 
and the KDC will return an error message. The error message returned by the KDC contains the 
proper salt value, and then Alice’s workstation can try again, this time knowing the proper salt 
value. The ENC-PART is encrypted with Alice’s master key. When decrypted, it contains the 
following fields: MSG-TYPE message type (11) PVNO protocol version number (5) PADATA 
(optional) salt to combine with the user’s password in order to compute the master key derived 
from the user’s password (see below) CREALM Alice’s realm CNAME Alice’s name. The purpose 
of Alice’s name and realm is to help Alice’s workstation figure out what key to use to decrypt the 
encrypted data. TICKET the ticket to Bob that Alice requested ENC-PART encrypted portion (see 
below) KEY encryption key associated with the ticket enclosed in the AS_REP LAST-REQ a 
sequence of from 0 to 5 timestamps specifying such information as when Alice last requested a 
TGT, or last requested any ticket. The specification is vague about how these times are 
supposed to be synchronized across KDC replicas. Indeed, the MIT implementation (as of the 
writing of this book) does not implement any of these, and always returns no timestamps in this 
field. NONCE the nonce copied from the AS_REQ KEY-EXPIRATION (optional) time when user’s 
master key will expire for the purpose of warning Alice to change her password FLAGS a copy of 
the flags that appear inside the ticket (so that Alice can check if the KDC granted all she 
requested in the request, and also allows her to detect malicious modification that might have 
been done to the AS_REQ) AUTH-TIME, START-TIME, ENDTIME, RENEW-TILL timestamps; 
START-TIME and RENEW-TILL are optional (see §12.4 Ticket Lifetimes) SREALM, SNAME Bob’s 
name and realm CADDR (optional) the set of addresses from which this ticket will be valid 324 
KERBEROS V5 12.15.6 12.15.6 TGS_REP A TGS_REP is the reply from the KDC to a TGS_REQ. It 
is virtually identical to an AS_REP. The differences are • There is never a PADATA field in a 
TGS_REP, whereas it is optional in an AS_REP. (The PADATA field in an AS_REP contains the 
salt.) • There is no KEY-EXPIRATION field in a TGS_REP, whereas it is optional in an AS_REP. • 
The ENC-PART field is encrypted with the key in the TGT or ticket sent in the TGS_REQ; or if a 
subkey is included in the authenticator sent in the TGS_REQ, then the ENC-PART is encrypted 
with that subkey. 12.15.7 AP_REQ An AP_REQ is the first message when Alice, who has 
obtained a ticket to Bob, actually attempts to communicate with Bob. MSG-TYPE message type 
(14) PVNO protocol version number (5) AP-OPTIONS flags, of which two are defined: USE-
SESSION-KEY, which means the ticket is encrypted under the session key in Bob’s TGT (rather 
than Bob’s master key—see §12.12 Double TGT Authentication) MUTUAL-REQUIRED, which 
tells Bob mutual authentication is requested TICKET the ticket to Bob AUTHENTICATOR an 
authenticator, proving Alice knows the key inside the ticket 12.15.8 KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES 
325 12.15.8 AP_REP An AP_REP is Bob’s reply to an AP_REQ from Alice. The encrypted section 
(CTIME through SEQ-NUMBER) is encrypted with the key inside the ticket from the AP_REQ, 
unless a SUBKEY field is included in the AUTHENTICATOR from the AP_REQ, in which case it is 
encrypted with the subkey. 12.15.9 KRB_SAFE A KRB_SAFE message transfers data between 


## Page 19

Alice and Bob with integrity protection. MSG-TYPE message type (15) PVNO protocol version 
number (5) The rest is encrypted: CTIME the time copied from the CTIME field of the 
authenticator in the AP_REQ CUSEC the low order bits of CTIME, since CTIME is expressed in 
seconds; this field specifies microseconds SUBKEY an optional field intended for Bob to be able 
to influence the Alice-Bob session key in an application-specific way SEQ-NUMBER starting 
sequence number for messages sent from Bob to Alice MSG-TYPE message type (20) PVNO 
protocol version number (5) USER-DATA whatever the application wants to send TIMESTAMP 
(optional) current time in seconds at the originator of the message, so the recipient can put 
messages in order, and can make sure the timestamp is within acceptable clock skew USEC

seconds SEQ-NUMBER (optional) sequence number of this message, so the recipient can 
detect lost messages and put messages in order S-ADDRESS the network address of the sender 
of the message (the same address is presumably in the network layer header, but here it is 
cryptographically protected) R-ADDRESS the recipient’s network address. Again, presumably it 
is equal to the destination address in the network layer header, but here it is cryptographically 
protected. CKSUM checksum on the fields USER-DATA through R-ADDRESS, using one of the 
checksum types defined in §12.8.1 Integrity-Only Algorithms 326 KERBEROS V5 12.15.10 
12.15.10 KRB_PRIV A KRB_PRIV message is encrypted (and integrity-protected) data sent 
between Alice and Bob. It is encrypted with the key arranged for this conversation. 12.15.11 
KRB_CRED A KRB_CRED message is used for passing credentials (a ticket and session key) for 
the purpose of delegation (see §12.3 Delegation of Rights). Assume Alice would like to delegate 
to Ted her right to access Bob. Alice would send Ted a KRB_CRED message containing a ticket 
to Bob, along with the session key corresponding to Bob’s ticket. The encrypted portion of the 
KRB_CRED message is encrypted using a key that has been established between Alice and Ted, 
so the assumption is that Alice has already initiated a Kerberos protected conversation to Ted, 
and they now share a key. MSG-TYPE message type (21) PVNO protocol version number (5) The 
rest is encrypted: USER-DATA whatever the applications wants to send TIMESTAMP (optional) 
current time in seconds at the originator of the message, so the recipient can put messages in 
order, and make sure the timestamp is within acceptable clock skew USEC (optional) the low 
order bits (the microsecond portion) of the time, since TIMESTAMP is in seconds SEQ-NUMBER 
(optional) sequence number of this message, so the recipient can detect lost messages and put

KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES 327 The TICKET-INFO field is a sequence of one or more repetitions 
of the following information: 12.15.12 KRB_ERROR In Kerberos V4 there were two types of error 
messages, one that would be returned by the KDC, the other returned by an application when 
authentication failed. In Kerberos V5 there is only one error message defined, and it is used for 
both purposes. None of the information in the error message is MSG-TYPE message type (22)

with Alice’s message. Here are all the error codes. Error codes 1–30 come only from the KDC, in

you that you didn’t make an error but it’s not going to do what you asked it to do anyway. In 
reality, this would never appear, and is probably listed in the documentation just to ensure 
nobody assigns error code 0 to a real error.) 1 Alice’s entry in the KDC database has expired. 2 
Bob’s entry in the KDC database has expired. 3 The requested Kerberos version number is not

forgotten the key with which Bob’s entry in its database was encrypted. 6 The KDC never heard 
of Alice. 7 The KDC never heard of Bob. 8 Either Bob or Alice appears in the KDC database 
multiple times. (Really, it would make more sense to check this when modifying the KDC 
database, or have a utility that checks this every once in awhile rather than checking this when 
requests are made.) 9 Either Bob or Alice’s entry in the KDC does not contain a master key (see 
parenthetical remark for error 8). 10 Alice asked for a postdated ticket, but her TGT does not 
allow this. 11 The requested start time is later than the end time (maybe the KDC should just 
give Alice the useless ticket that she requested). 12.15.12 KERBEROS V5 MESSAGES 329 12
